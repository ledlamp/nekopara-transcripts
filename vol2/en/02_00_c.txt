Chocola: 「Zzz... Zzz...」
Chocola: 「Master~♪ Nyehehehe...♪」
Vanilla: 「Chocola... Master...♪ Nyahehe...♪」
Kashou: 「...You two sure are childish for grown catgirls.」
I sit there comfortably, thinking, as my two catgirls lean on either arm.
I stare up at the ceiling, a content smile spreading across my face.
Kashou: 「...I had a vague idea of what it'd be like when I open the shop, but...」
I can really live out each day in happiness...
...Having Chocola and Vanilla here by my side.
Kashou: 「...Sounds like something a pet owner would say.」
I stare lovingly at their adorable, sleeping faces...
...And gently rub their heads.
Chocola: 「Mmfufu~ That feels nice, Master...♪」
Vanilla: 「Pet us... more~ More...♪」
Kashou: 「Come on now, get over here and hop in your futons.」
Chocola: 「Master should come over here~」
Vanilla: 「I strongly agree~」
Kashou: 「Don't be ridiculous, you two. Come on, let's go.」
Chocola: 「Nya~n, Master's a perv~♪」
Vanilla: 「He's a such a pervy patissier... Not that I mind...」
Nothing's really changed. It's the same as always.
The calm of night then quietly washed over us.
