Coconut: 「Onii-chan, look, look! I found something else I can do!」
Coconut: 「I did up a receipt for an online order perfectly! I did a good job, didn't I?」
Kashou: 「Oh, yeah, good job. You're really giving it your all, aren't you, Coconut?」
I pat Coconut, who's got a pleased look on her face.
Coconut: 「Chocola taught me how to do it! Purr purr purr~♪」
Coconut: 「Meow~♪ Being pet by Onii-chan feels so good~♪」
She rubs her cheek across my chest.
I guess a catgirl is a catgirl even if she's huge.
...Unlike Chocola and Vanilla, she has a very womanly figure.
She's got a really ample bust and shapely butt, too.
I've started really seeing her more as a woman, and she's quite attracti--
...Wait, no, stop that!
No matter how you look at it, Coconut's just a naive kitten!
Shigure might have been trying to push you in that direction yesterday, but that still doesn't mean you should start looking at her like that, Kashou!
I scold myself internally.
Coconut: 「...Onii-chan, what's wrong?」
Kashou: 「Huh? N-Nothing. What are you talking about?」
Coconut: 「You just looked really troubled for some reason...」
Coconut: 「...Do you... not like this? Do you want me to stop?」
She looks up at me with eyes full of concern.
Her face is so innocent.
Guilt begins to tear at my heart.
I take a deep breath to try to hide what I'm thinking from Coconut...
...And gently stroke her once more.
Kashou: 「There's no way I'd hate it when you're playful, you know?
Kashou: 「It's cute, but I was just a little embarrassed.」
Coconut: 「Embarrassed? You're just like always, though.」
Coconut: 「Teehee. My onii-chan sure is silly, purr purr~ ♪」
She rubs her whole body against me without even a hint of shame.
This is just a catgirl's display of affection, right?! It's how a catgirl shows her love! It's just how she shows her love...!!
She's soft and supple no matter where I touch.
I try to drive away my impure thoughts by cautioning myself over and over again in my head like I'm chanting a spell.
Chocola: 「Hey! Coco-chan is snuggling up with Master!」
Chocola: 「Master! Chocola too! Chocola wants to be pet, too! Pet us both!」
Coconut: 「Okay, let's let Chocola join in~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Yaaay! I love you too, Coco-chan! Purr purr purr~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Hey, don't just force me to pet you both now...!」
Chocola and Coconut coil around me.
Chocola: 「Hrmm?! Hmm hmm hmm hrmm?!」
Coconut: 「Huh? What's wrong, Chocola?」
Chocola: 「Coconut, is it okay if Chocola just...」
Chocola disentangles herself from me and latches onto Coconut.
She squeezes Coconut several times...
...Almost as though she's not quite sure what she's feeling.
Chocola: 「Hm... hmhm... hrmm...」
Coconut: 「Wh-What's wrong, Chocola? Is there... something wrong with me?」
Chocola: 「Coco-chan, your boobies are so cushiony! So flubby-wubby!」
Chocola: 「Wow, this is crazy! They feel so squishy, meow!」
Coconut: 「Huh? Uh... A-Are they...?」
Chocola: 「Vanilla's have a totally different feel to them...」
Chocola: 「Right here! They're super-duper soft right here!」
Coconut: 「Th-Thanks... I guess...?」
Coconut watches in amazement as Chocola bounces around in excitement...
...But gets more and more worn out with each hug.
...Well, it's not like I wasn't thinking about their differences a minute ago.
I guess I can understand how Chocola feels...
Chocola: 「Hrmmm...! Hmm hmm hmm hrmm...!」
Chocola: 「...Master's starting to get a pervy look on his face! He can't help it!」
Coconut: 「W-What...?! A-A pervy... look...?!」
Chocola: 「Yep, a pervy look. Master got all excited when he was petting you.」
Coconut: 「E-Excited...?! What do you mean...」
She looks at me as her eyes widen and face turns bright red.
Kashou: 「...No, no, I wasn't looking at you like that, okay?」
An awkward pause hangs in the air.
...Well, I guess you could argue that I was leering at her, but...
...It's not like I wasn't able to control myself... right?
...Um... I guess I should say something...
...But thanks to these unexpected developments, I'm left speechless.
Coconut: 「Y-Yeah, right?! You weren't doing that at all, right?!」
Coconut: 「I'm, like, just way too childish. You'd never look at me like that, right...?!」
Coconut: 「Onii-chan just thinks I'm some helpless little catgirl, right...?!」
Coconut: 「A catgirl like me is in no way alluring... right?!」
Coconut: 「After all, I'm just a catgirl and your little sister... I'm not attractive, and I'm totally useless, and...」
Coconut: 「...And... Ugh, saying all that about myself has got me down... Ahaha...」
Why does she keep torturing herself like this?
Kashou: 「No, I didn't mean anything like that...」
Coconut: 「Huh? You mean...?」
Coconut: 「............」
Coconut: 「Onii-chan was... at me... um...」
Coconut: 「...Looking at me... and thinking naughty things, then...?」
Kashou: 「...Sure?」
I blurt out something I didn't mean to say while at a loss for words again.
She looks up at me again, her eyes both troubled and happy.
She stares at me as she plays with her fingers.
No, I... I didn't mean to make it seem like I was looking at her that way...
...I was just trying to be careful, so that it wouldn't look like I was.
I mean, Coconut is innocent, sincere, and certainly still a little catgirl...
...But she has the figure of a pin-up model.
My eyes cloud over a bit.
Coconut's face seems to have become extremely attractive.
Before I realize it, I'm checking her out, up and down.
Chocola: 「Coco-chan is super sexy!」
Chocola: 「That face you're making is, like, really turning Chocola on! Really, really!」
Coconut: 「T-Turning you on...?! Wh-Wha...?!」
Chocola: 「Right, Master? You're getting horny, too, right?」
Kashou: 「Don't say crude things like that.」
Chocola: 「Meowgh! Master is-- Hmmf hmmf hmmrghh!!」
I clamp a hand over Chocola's mouth before she can say anything more.
I take a deep breath and look at Coconut sternly.
Kashou: 「Why don't we just forget about this whole thing for now?」
Kashou: 「Let's all focus back on task. We're still at work here.」
Kashou: 「Coconut, if you know how to do the receipts for the online orders now, would you mind taking care of the shipping addresses as well?」
Coconut: 「O-Okay, I got it...」
Coconut: 「A-Alright, I'll go get it done up! I'll just be a sec!」
With an awkward nod, she runs out to the storefront.
Kashou: 「............」
...Now that I've noticed, I can't unsee it.
Originally, I just thought she was cute and friendly.
But now that I'm aware of her body, it's all I can do to avert my eyes...
And now, both Shigure and Chocola are trying to spur me on. What a headache.
Kashou: 「...Hm, Chocola?」
I look over at the catgirl, who has suddenly gone silent.
Chocola: 「Mmmph, nghhhh...!」
Chocola: 「Pshh, pshh...! Mgrnmmm... mmn...!」
Kashou: 「C-Crap, sorry, Chocola! I didn't realize I had put my hand over your nose too!」
Kashou: 「Stay with me! Stay with me, Chocolaaaaa!!」
I almost just ended my beloved catpanion's life.
Vanilla: 「La Soleil is now all closed up for the day.」
Vanilla: 「Everyone's already gone home. Chocola's upstairs changing, too.」
Kashou: 「Alright, good work today. Thanks.」
I respond to Vanilla, who had popped her head into the kitchen, with a wave of my hand.
Vanilla: 「Do you need help doing inventory? If you do, I'll help.」
Kashou: 「Nah, I don't have much left to take care of. Thanks, though.」
Kashou: 「You can go upstairs and watch TV if you want.」
Vanilla: 「Understood. I shall go and watch television.」
Vanilla: 「But first, I want to ask you something, Master. May I?」
Kashou: 「Hm? What's up?」
Vanilla: 「Coconut was completely spaced out this afternoon. Did something happen to her?」
Kashou: 「...This afternoon?」
Vanilla: 「Yeah, she kept making mistakes on the delivery forms.」
Vanilla: 「I double-checked all of them, so there shouldn't be any issues now, though.」
Kashou: 「I see...」
Vanilla: 「Do you know if something happened?」
Kashou: 「...No, well, it wasn't really anything important...」
Oh, I definitely know what happened.
I spewed out something stupid and had to keep my eyes off her.
Vanilla: 「Hmm...?」
She gazes inquisitively at me as if she has something to say.
Does she know...?
...Or maybe she just suspects something. Which one is it...?
Just what is Vanilla thinking? I have no idea!
Vanilla: 「Well, Master is a catgirl gigolo, after all. I guess it's only natural.」
Vanilla: 「Chocola seemed turned on for some reason, too.」
Vanilla: 「You're such a pervert, Master.」
Kashou: 「I don't understand how Chocola being excited makes me a pervert.」
...I really have no idea what she's trying to say.
Well, this isn't any different from her usual behavior, but...
Kashou: 「Come to think of it, you got a package, Vanilla. It's from Amazoom.」
Kashou: 「Is this what you ordered the other day when you two were celebrating?」
I'm just going to change the subject for now.
That's one way to get out of things.
Vanilla: 「Master, I just recalled some urgent business that I must attend to. Please excuse me.」
Kashou: 「What's this about all of a sudden?」
I watch Vanilla shoot upstairs at cat-speed.
...There isn't anything for me to be guilty about, is there?
I don't really want to hear anything more about what happened with Coconut this afternoon though...
Kashou: 「...I knew it. I can't get her out of my mind now.」
Coconut's sensual expression suddenly appears in my head.
I keep thinking about how soft her body was.
...And now Shigure, Chocola, and Vanilla are trying to egg me on.
But I can't let them.
If this keeps up...
...No, I'm mature enough to overcome this.
Chocola: 「Master, Master~」
Chocola: 「Are you done with work? Are you done?」
Kashou: 「As you can see, Chocola, no, not yet.」
Chocola: 「Hrm, I see, is that so? Not done, huh?」
She doesn't sound very satisfied with that answer...
...And suddenly latches onto my back.
Chocola: 「When are you gonna be done? How long, huh?」
Kashou: 「I don't think it'll take much longer...」
Kashou: 「...Why are you being so impatient? You're acting weird, you know.」
What's with this attitude from her?
It seems way too subtle a tactic for Chocola.
She's normally much easier to understand than Vanilla.
Chocola: 「Hmm, I'm acting weird, am I?」」
Chocola: 「Chocola is super frustrated~」
Chocola: 「I was just thinking, as your catpanion, you should do whatever I want, right?」
Her motive is pretty obvious...
That's about what I'd expect from Chocola.
I'm not sure how to respond to her.
Chocola: 「But, mew know? Don't you think you've been neglecting us lately?」
Chocola: 「Chocola got all excited today, and she's been turned on ever since, meow~」
Chocola: 「Chocola's been waiting patiently all this time, meow meow~」
She's totally trying to seduce me.
She meows sensually as she wraps herself around me.
Vanilla wasn't kidding when she said Chocola was horny.
Chocola: 「Vanilla's gonna be preoccupied watching the animal DVD she got from Amazoom for the next six hours, too~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Come on now, Master...」
Chocola: 「Mm, smooch... shlp... Mm, lick, smack... Hnghh, chlp~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Pwah~ ♪ Teehee... Chocola loves kissing Master... Mmn...」
Chocola: 「Mm, hngh, shlp... Mm, shlurp, shlp... Lick, slck... Slurp, smooch~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Haah, Master~ ♪ Do you understand just how turned on I am, meow...?」
As Chocola and I exchange saliva...
...She looks up at me, narrowing her glistening eyes, and smiles.
Kashou: 「...You're really naughty, Chocola.」
Chocola: 「But that's only nyatural when Chocola's with her beloved master~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Catgirls never hide anything. Our feelings... and our bodies too~ ♪」
Chocola: 「But you knew that, right...?」

Chocola: 「Mmph, shlp, slurp... Shlp, squelch... Lick~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Slurp, shlp, lick~ ♪ Hah, nn... Slurp, slurpppp... lick~ ♪」
She wraps her arms around my neck.
She sticks her tongue even deeper into my mouth and stirs it around.
We don't even care that our saliva is dribbling out from our lips.
She gulps down my spit while making lewd sounds.
Chocola: 「Haah, Master's saliva is... so yummy~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Now, let's...」
Coconut: 「Wha-- Ngh...!」
Coconut: 「O-Onii-chan...?! Chocola...?!」
Coconut's eyes widen as she holds the door open.
She freezes the moment she sees Chocola and me.
Immediately realizing what she's stumbled upon, she averts her eyes and her face turns bright red.
Coconut: 「I-I'm... sorry...! It's... I-I...!」
Coconut: 「I just... wanted to talk to Onii-chan...! Um...!」
Coconut: 「I didn't... really... Um, I didn't mean to interrupt you two...!」
She shuts her eyes...
...And shakes her head apologetically.
Kashou: 「No, it's, uhh... our fault...」
Coconut: 「I-It's not...! I'm the one... who barged in...!」
Coconut: 「...You two are, like, lovers... So it's, um... natural, right...?」
Coconut: 「Gahhh!」
Coconut: 「W-What the hell am I saying?! Sorry! I'm going home!」
Kashou: 「Ah, w-wait a sec!」
I grab Coconut's shoulder, preventing her from leaving.
Coconut: 「Wah...♪」
Kashou: 「Ah, sorry...! I didn't mean to grab you so hard...!」
Coconut: 「Oh, no... It... didn't hurt or anything...」
Coconut: 「It was just so sudden, and I was kind of suprised, is all...」
Coconut: 「............」
Coconut: 「Onii-chan... um...」
Coconut: 「...Can you... let go of me...?」
Kashou: 「Oh...! Sorry...!」
I quickly take my hand off her.
Coconut: 「............」
Just a hair away from me...
...Coconut's fiddling with her fingers in embarrassment.
She looks up at me with a hurt expression.
Coconut: 「...Onii-chan...」
I stopped her from leaving, but...
...What do I do now?
I know that making up some excuse about all this wouldn't make things any better...
...And I can't just brush it off or change the subject, either...
Time passes as we stare at each other in silence.
Coconut: 「...I'm sorry.」
Kashou: 「Huh? Wh-What for...?」
Coconut: 「For trying to run away without saying anything...」
Coconut: 「That's... why I'm apologizing...」
Her eyes wander about...
...As her voice trails off to a soft murmur.
With her arms crossed tightly across her body...
...She continues to speak, her face totally flushed.
Coconut: 「...Um, it's just that Chocola's normally so cute and innocent...」
Coconut: 「...But she's acting sexy and doing such dirty things with you...」
Coconut: 「I was... just so surprised, really...」
Coconut: 「I guess it's natural, since you two are lovers and all, but...」
Coconut: 「...I'm her older sister, and... um...」
Coconut: 「...I've never done that sort of thing... so I...」
A long, pained sigh escapes her lips.
She looks at me pleadingly as she bites her lip.
Coconut: 「...My heart is beating so fast, I feel like it's going to burst.」
Coconut: 「I feel so hot, and my mind has gone blank...」
Coconut: 「My legs feel like jelly, like they're going to give way...」
Coconut: 「...And I have no idea why all this is happening...」
Coconut: 「Ohh... Onii-chan, I'm sorryyy...」
I can see...
...Her heterochromatic eyes begin to fill with tears.
Her slender fingers wrap around her arms...
...As she gazes up at me pitifully.
She lets out another anguished sigh from her half-parted lips.
...She's so damn sexy.
This isn't the usual, energetic Coconut...
...This is a woman swept away by her desire.
Her sweet voice sends shivers down my spine.
I have the sudden, irrepressible urge to embrace her.
Chocola: 「Teehee, Coco-chaaan~?」
Coconut: 「Ch-Chocola...?」
