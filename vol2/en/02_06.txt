Shigure: 「Hohohohoh!!」
Shigure: 「Hohohohohohoh!!」
Shigure: 「Today is a truly, surprisingly wonderful day~ ♪」
Shigure: 「Good job! Good job, Azuki!!」
Shigure: 「I would have never expected you to follow in Coconut's footsteps, Azuki.」
Shigure: 「Nii-sama is falling head over heels in love with all of my catgirls~ ♪」
Shigure: 「It's wonderful, isn't it? Hohohohoh~!!」
Azuki: 「Y-Yeah... Well, I mean... Well...」
Azuki: 「...Catgirls live a long time. Who knows what'll happen during our lifespan?」
...This whole situation feels like deja vu.
I'm more concerned about my maniacally laughing sister than the deja vu, though.
Shigure: 「I always took you as a rather cold person, Nii-sama, but it seems like even you can fall in love, huh~?」
Shigure: 「The wide gulf between reality and perception truly arouses your little sister's heart~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Well... Uh, I guess... Sorry...?」
Shigure: 「What are you saying?! There is nothing to apologize for!」
Shigure: 「Especially now that you are having affairs with both Azuki and Coconut...」
Shigure: 「Us humans are bound to follow certain ethics and laws...」
Shigure: 「...But Chocola, Vanilla, Azuki, and Coconut are catgirls! They're all catgirls!」
Shigure: 「If Nii-sama wishes to pursue my catgirls, all I can do is give him my blessing!」
Shigure: 「What could this be other than a legal harem?」
Shigure: 「Ah, it's wonderful! What a wonderful, loving family we have, Nii-sama!」
Kashou: 「No, uh... I wasn't... really trying for that, but...」
Shigure: 「Now, let us shout it from the rooftops!」
Shigure: 「This is it! This is our family's Neko Paradise!」
Shigure: 「Hey, mon frere! Disons Neko Paradise! Wooooo!!」
Kashou: 「No, don't... Listen to me, Shigure!」
Kashou: 「You're going to disturb the neighbors, so lower your voice a bit, okay?」
Azuki: 「Nothin' you say will reach her now, Kashou...」
Azuki: 「When she gets like this, there's only one thing you can do: buckle up...」
Kashou: 「Yeah, I guess...」
We watch Shigure's back, helpless.
...I can't believe something like this has happened two days in a row.
I guess it just goes to show that you never know what'll happen down the road...
I stare off into the distance and tune out Shigure's insane laughter.
Coconut: 「Yep, yep! I know that feeling all too well, Onee-chan!」
Coconut: 「I get you even more than anyone else does...!」
Azuki: 「Yeah, whatever...」
Azuki: 「I have no idea what to say to that...」
Coconut: 「It's fine! We're sisters, after all! There's nothing you need to say, Onee-chan!」
Azuki: 「...Well, I guess that's that.」
She shakes Coconut's hand, a baffled expression on her face.
I'm probably making an equally puzzled expression right now.
Cinnamon: 「To think that both Azu-nyan and Nacchan would become Kashou's catpanions~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「I'm a bit jealous! Aren't you, May-chan?」
Maple: 「What? Why're you asking me?!」
Maple: 「There's nothing for me to be jealous of. I have no interest in that sort of thing.」
Cinnamon: 「There you go, saying silly things like that again~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「May-chan, it's only natural for a catgirl our age to be interested in that stuff, you know?」
Cinnamon: 「Oh yes, we're at that age~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「O-Oh, May-chan's going to...! May-chan's going to cast aside her cool demeanor, and...! ♪」
Cinnamon: 「You can't, May-chan! You can't do such nyaughty things~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「Cinnamon is gonna drooooool...!!」
Maple: 「You're getting kind of gross there... Seriously, cut it out...」
Chocola: 「Yawwwwn~ Good meowning, Master~」
Vanilla: 「Oh?! Are we throwing some kind of big party right now...?」
Vanilla: 「Or did we miss everything already...?」
Shigure: 「Now, this is a party you two simply can't miss!」
Shigure: 「As experienced catpanions, you two must teach your sisters how to capture Nii-sama's heart!」
Chocola: 「How to capture Nii-sama's heart...?」
Vanilla: 「I know... like, by doing something lewd... Zzz...」
Chocola: 「Myahah~ It's only just morning, and Shigure is already being so lewd, meow~ Zzz...」
Kashou: 「...Alright, girls, wrap it up. We have work to do.」
For the second day in a row, I gaze out at the chaotic living room.
If you were to say this is how things usually are, you wouldn't be wrong...
...I mean, this is the second day in a row now.
Even I didn't see something like this coming, but...
...I smile wryly to myself, knowing that ultimately, I'm the root of the problem.
Kashou: 「...Let's just get ready to open the shop, okay?」
Kashou: 「I need you guys to actually do your jobs now.」
I watch as they escape to the bakery floor.
Coconut: 「Onee-chan, I guess sisters really do end up falling for the same guy, right?」
Coconut: 「It makes me happy to know that we're similar in a way! Eheheh~ ♪」
Azuki: 「Yeah, well... I dunno if I agree with ya on that...」
Azuki: 「But, that's enough of this topic for now...」
Shigure: 「Wait, Coconut? Azuki?」
Shigure: 「What did Nii-chan's virility feel like, hmm?」
Shigure: 「You simply must tell me in full detail~ ♪」
Coconut: 「Th-That's way too embarrassing, Shigure...!」
Azuki: 「Th-That's not somethin' you're supposed to ask someone about...!」
Azuki: 「You ain't gettin' a peep outta me, so leave me alone!」
Azuki: 「Ah, dammit... I guess this is what they mean when they say love makes you dumb...!!」
Shigure: 「Coconut and Azuki, you're both such wonderful catgirls~ ♪」
Shigure: 「Your feminine expressions are simply irresistible! Hohohohohoh~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Eheheh, Chocola is so glad everyone is getting along right myaow~ ♪」
Chocola: 「But Chocola is Master's primary wife, right? Right?」
Vanilla: 「I will allow Chocola to share first place with me.」
Vanilla: 「Master is truly a pervy patissiere, so there's nothing we can do. Truly, nothing we can do.」
Kashou: 「Uh, well, um...」
Kashou: 「...I-I care about everyone very much, so...」
Chocola: 「Myahahah~ ♪ Master's so cute when he's flustered! ♪」
Vanilla: 「Catgirls don't care about things like affairs, so there's no reason for anyone to sneak around.」
Cinnamon: 「H-Hey, May-chan?」
Cinnamon: 「Um... Maybe... It's just a guess now, but just maybe...」
Cinnamon: 「...If this pattern keeps up...」
Cinnamon: 「...Do you think that... you and I will get our turns next~?」
Maple: 「What? What are you talking about, 'pattern'?」
Maple: 「Could you not talk to me like I'm some sort of loose Molly cat?」
Cinnamon: 「But... but, you know~? Don't you think everyone would be happy together~?」
Maple: 「Quit saying stupid stuff like that. My mind isn't as messed up as yours.」
Maple: 「Sorry, but I am not some catgirl toy to be pumped and dumped.」
Shigure: 「There's so much I've learned from the internet. I should teach you all a thing or two~ ♪」
Azuki: 「I don't give a damn about any of that. Seriously, back off...」
Coconut: 「Well, I might be just a little interested... Eheheh~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「Just hear me out, May-chan~!」
Maple: 「Why are you so damn persistent?! Geez!」
Chocola: 「Master~! You need to keep rub-rubbing and pet-petting Chocola, too, you know~!!」
Vanilla: 「If you forget me, you'll regret it. Catgirls can get quite lonesome, you know.」
Kashou: 「Alright, alright, there there there~」
Chocola&Vanilla: 「Nya~♪」
Everyone is in good spirits as we prepare to open the cafe for the day.
Things have been pretty busy up to this point.
I'm sure things are only going to get more lively from here on out, too.
Kashou: 「...Well, it is how it is, I guess.」
I mutter to myself as I'm surrounded by cute catgirls.
Shigure: 「Now that the Minaduki family bond has been strengthened...」
Shigure: 「...It's time for La Soleil to open~ ♪」
All: 「Aight.」「Alright!」「Very well♪"「Oka~y.」「Oka~y!」「Indeed.」
And once more, La Soleil, also known as 「Neko Paradise」, opens for the day.
