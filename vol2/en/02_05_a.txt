Shigure: 「Hohohohoh!」
Shigure: 「Today is a truly wonderful day~ ♪」
Shigure: 「How splendid, how absolutely splendid. There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Coconut.」
Shigure: 「I'm so proud that you, one of my darling catgirls, has gained Nii-sama's favor! Hohohoh~ ♪」
Coconut: 「Don't! You're embarrassing me! Keep your voice down... Auuuuuh...」
Shigure beams...
...As Coconut hides in the corner.
...I can only guess at what's going on here.
Kashou: 「...Coconut?」
Coconut flinches upon hearing my voice.
Coconut: 「I-It's not what you think, Onii-chan...!!」
Coconut: 「I... I wasn't going to tell her anything...!」
Coconut: 「But Shigure-chan is...! Shigure-chan's too crafty...!!」
Shigure: 「That's quite true, isn't it, Nii-sama. Please don't blame poor Coconut.」
Shigure: 「Getting Coconut to let the cat out of the bag was easier than stealing catnip from a kitten.」
Shigure: 「Besides, although I am young, I am still a woman.」
Shigure: 「And a woman's intuition is something too subtle for men to grasp, no? Hohohohoh~ ♪」
Coconut: 「Aughhh, I'm sorry, Onii-chan...」
Coconut: 「Shigure-chan just suddenly started asking me tons of stuff, and I didn't know how to answer, so...」
Kashou: 「...Yeah, if it was me, I don't think I could have even escaped her.」
Shigure's triumphant laughter reinforces that thought.
She might be my little sister, but damn, she can sure be frightening...
Coconut: 「B-But Shigure-chan is my master!」
Coconut: 「And Onii-chan said that was okay, too!」
Shigure: 「Teehee~ Even though her heart is loyal to me, it seems her body still longs for you, Nii-sama...」
Shigure: 「Ahh, it makes me shiver so! Both my body and soul are set ablaze~ ♪」
Shigure: 「This is it! This is what it means to be truly alive, Coconut!」
Shigure: 「Although I thought of you of as still a little catgirl, you are, without doubt, now a fully grown catgirl of mine!!」
Coconut: 「You're wrong! I don't really understand, but I think you're wrong, Shigure-chan!」
Kashou: 「...This isn't good.」
The tension between the two is unbearable.
She might be my little sister, but damn, she can be absolutely frightening...
Azuki: 「Yo, wassup? Time to get crackin' today, yeah?」
Cinnamon: 「Oh my, oh my? I sense a strange mood in the air~」
Maple: 「Shigure sure seems to be in much higher spirits than normal.」
Kashou: 「Well... We'll talk about this later.」
I mutter, staring at Shigure's back as she continues to laugh maniacally.
Cinnamon: 「With how Shigure-chan and Nacchan are acting, I think I can put the puzzle pieces together~」
Maple: 「Whatever. It doesn't seem like it's got anything to do with me.」
Kashou: 「You figured it out...?」
Kashou: 「...What, seriously?」
Cinnamon: 「She's acting like Chocola and Vanilla did back then~」
Maple: 「Well, as long as Coconut is happy, everything's fine, right?」
Maple: 「Right, Azuki?」
Azuki: 「...Huh? Ah... Y-Yeah, for sure.」
Azuki: 「Uh, well, I mean... Well, yeah, whatevs?」
Azuki: 「It's like, um... It's between those lovebirds, not me...」
Azuki: 「Not really somethin' we need to meddle in, or whatever...」
Maple: 「...Wow, what's up with you?」
Cinnamon: 「Azu-chan sure has none of her usual sarcasm today, huh~」
Azuki: 「Sh-Shut it...! You blockheads don't know what you're talkin' about!」
Maple: 「Whoa, why are you getting all mad at us for? It makes no sense.」
Cinnamon: 「Now, now~ No fighting, you two~」
Cinnamon: 「If you don't hurry and get changed, the bakery will open without you~ Right, Azu-chan?」
Azuki: 「Y-Yeah, exactly. Let's go get changed already!」
Azuki: 「See ya, Kashou! Have fun with all that!」
Azuki: 「Hey Chocola, Vanilla! You two can't keep sleepin' forever!」
Azuki: 「We got some heavy liftin' to do today, and it ain't gonna be fun, so it's time to get your butts in gear!」
Maple: 「Yeah, it's time to get up! We're going to borrow your room to get changed in, okay?」
Cinnamon: 「You two'll end up oversleeping if you don't wake up~」
Chocola: 「Fwah~ Good morning, Master... Zzz...」
Vanilla: 「What's with all this noise...? Are we running late...?」
Kashou: 「Get up! Wash your faces and go get changed, you two.」
Kashou: 「It's almost time to open the bakery.」
Chocola: 「Oh, okayyy~ Rogerzzz... Zzzz...」
Vanilla: 「Rogerzzz... Zzz...」
Coconut: 「Auuh, Onii-chan...」
Coconut: 「I'm sorry for what happened this morning...」
Kashou: 「It's nothing you need to apologize for, Coconut.」
Kashou: 「I'll talk to the others about it when I can.」
I pat the dejected Coconut's head as her face flushes.
...Though I suppose everyone's probably figured it out by now.
What Shigure mentioned before, a 'woman's intuition', is something I'm sure the catgirls have as well.
Kashou: 「...I mean, it's not like you've done something you should regret.」
Kashou: 「If they start picking on you, there's nothing wrong with fighting back, right?」
Coconut: 「...Yeah, you're right.」
Coconut: 「Thanks, Onii-chan...」
Coconut: 「I was so happy. I don't regret anything.」
It was that smile...
...That swept me up in the first place.
I can't help but think that things turned out for the best.
Shigure: 「Alright, alright, this is just one more way that the Minaduki family strengthens its bonds.」
Shigure: 「Let us open the shop while we're in high spirits, shall we?」
Kashou: 「Yeah, sounds good.」
Kashou: 「Coconut, you get changed too. I'm counting on you today, okay?」
Coconut: 「Okay! I'll give it my best!」
And with that, a new day begins.
Vanilla: 「I told you Master is a perv.」
Vanilla: 「You saw an opportunity while I was occupied watching that animal DVD and took it without a second thought, you sneak. You pervy pastry puffer, you.」
Kashou: 「You were the one who decided to watch that DVD, Vanilla」
I prepare the apple pie's crust...
...And then hand it over to Vanilla, who is making the lattice to go over the top.
Vanilla: 「I'm a little upset that I was left out of your bonding session.」
Vanilla: 「I'll be frank. If you're going to do those things, invite me, too.」
Kashou: 「Vanilla, you're the real pervy pastry puffer here.」
Vanilla: 「No, no, I am merely your apprentice.」
Vanilla: 「But I'm not saying that I dislike the title.」
Kashou: 「Wait, you don't?!」
We chat among ourselves as we work...
...And I confirm the amount of stock we have and transfer it into the refrigerator.
Kashou: 「...Well, catgirls are pretty open with that sort of thing...」
Kashou: 「You and Chocola aren't shy, that's for sure... It's definitely different for humans, though...」
Vanilla: 「Catgirls, by nature, don't recognize concepts like marriage.」
Vanilla: 「It's only when we live in houses, have masters, and are trained that we become human-like.」
Vanilla: 「We might get jealous, but we don't care about monogamy. A catgirl's love is profound. Noble.」
Vanilla: 「Right, Azuki?」
Azuki: 「Uh, huh? Ah, w-well, I guess...」
Azuki: 「M-More importantly, I'm finished makin' the filling, Kashou!」
Azuki: 「I'm gonna let it cool over here, so don't forget about it!」
Azuki: 「Hey, Vanilla, pass me the egg wash, will ya? Gonna need it to glaze the pies in a bit.」
Vanilla: 「...You're suddenly working so hard, Azuki.」
Vanilla: 「I wonder what's gotten into you.」
Kashou: 「Well, don't ask me...」
She's been going all out since she got here today.
She got a bit caught up in the commotion earlier, though...
Azuki: 「Want me to start glazin' this pie now?」
Kashou: 「Just a sec, Azuki.」
Azuki: 「Huh? What's up?」
Azuki: 「...Wait.」
Azuki: 「H-Hey...! Kashou...?!」
Kashou: 「That's not the best angle to brush the pie from.」
Kashou: 「You have to lay the brush flat on its side, like this...」
I take Azuki's hand from behind her...
...And, still holding it, I move the egg-covered brush across the pie to show her how it's done.
Azuki: 「Ah... Uh... K-Kashou...」
Azuki: 「Uh... Uhhh...」
Kashou: 「...Just like that.」
Kashou: 「You don't want to put too much on. Even a little bit of glaze will--」
Kashou: 「...Err, Azuki? What's wrong?」
Azuki: 「...Huh?!」
Azuki: 「N-Nothin's wrong! I need to make sure the glaze doesn't get on the pie, right?!」
Kashou: 「No, it has to go on the pie...」
I've never seen Azuki be this flustered before.
There's no way that this is a coincidence...
Kashou: 「Seriously, Azuki, what's wrong? You've been acting strange all day.」
Azuki: 「I-I said nothin's wrong...!」
Azuki: 「I've been like this since the day I was born--」
Vanilla: 「...?」
Vanilla: 「...Hmm.」
Vanilla: 「Azuki's tail is all puffed up.」
Azuki: 「NnyaaAaaAaahh?!」
Azuki: 「D-Damn it, Vanilla! The hell you doin'?! You made me make a weird sound!!」
Vanilla: 「Hohohohoh~ Sorry, I couldn't help myself.」
Vanilla: 「Azuki makes such a cute meow when she's suprised.」
Vanilla: 「Well, that's all I came here for. Adieu~」
Azuki: 「............」
Azuki: 「Damn it man, I can never tell what that Vanilla is thinkin'!」
Kashou: 「Yeah... No kidding.」
Azuki: 「Anyway, let's get back to work!」
Azuki: 「We gotta make the custard for the cream puffs next, right?」
Azuki: 「Oh man, there's so much to do!」
Kashou: 「............」
I'm not really sure what's gotten into Azuki.
Well, it doesn't seem like she wants to go into detail about it right now, anyway.
...We do need to get to work, though.
The two of us remain silent as we work.
Azuki: 「Hey, Kashou, how's this for the custard?」
I turn to face her.
Atop the counter is a bowl filled with our bakery's signature custard.
Kashou: 「...It really doesn't take you long to get the hang of things, huh?」
I'm reminded of her skill yet again.
It's only been a little while, but Azuki is now back to her usual self.
Maybe she's right and there really is nothing to worry about.
Azuki: 「I'm gonna put this in the fridge, okay?」
Azuki: 「Hrm, where's the plastic wrap...?」
She peers under the counter in her search.
Azuki: 「Ah, here it is. Now then--」
Azuki: 「Ah, crap! The custard's gonna fall...!」
Kashou: 「Watch out!!」
I catch the bowl before it hits the ground...
...But custard still splatters everywhere.
Kashou: 「Are you okay, Azuki? Did any get on you?」
Azuki: 「S-Sorry, Kashou...! I'm fine, but...!」
Kashou: 「Ah, some got on your face. Sorry!」
Kashou: 「Looks like none got on your clothes or hair, though. Good.」
Azuki: 「You got custard all over your hands, though...」
Azuki: 「Damn it, this is all 'cause of my carelessness. I worked so hard on it too, my poor custard...」
Still covered in custard, she looks down dejectedly.
Kashou: 「Come on, don't look so sad.」
Kashou: 「It's not like we need the custard right this moment, anyway.」
Kashou: 「And besides that, who cares? It's just custard. I'm more concerned about you.」
Azuki: 「Nah, this is all 'cause I was careless...」
She blushes and looks away awkwardly.
...I mean, it really isn't that big of a deal...
There's definitely something up with her today.
She's being strangely reserved and way too modest.
As I wonder, I lick some of the custard that remained on my hands off.
Kashou: 「Lick, lick...」
Kashou: 「...Hm? Hey, this is delicious.」
Azuki: 「K-Kashou...? Wh-What are you doing...?!」
Kashou: 「I just thought it'd be a waste if I didn't at least taste it.」
Kashou: 「Suck, lick, lick.」
Kashou: 「I never taught you how to make custard, but you still did such a stellar job on it, lick, lick.」
Azuki: 「I-I did...? I-It's not that big a deal, though...」
Azuki: 「Hng...!」
She fidgets restlessly, pressing her fingertips together.
She steals a quick glance at me.
...Seriously, what's with her today?
It's almost as if she has something she wants to tell me, but...
Kashou: 「...Do you want to try too, Azuki?」
Azuki: 「Whaat?! Wh-What do you mean?!」
Kashou: 「I just thought you might want to try some...」
Kashou: 「It's really good. Here.」
I extend my custard-covered hand toward Azuki's face.
Azuki: 「T-Try it...? Um, but...」
Azuki: 「!!!」
Azuki: 「...Well, I guess... if you say so, then... just a little...」
Though she's very hesitant, she nods in agreement.
Kashou: 「Oh, there's a spoon over there you can use--」
Azuki: 「Haah... Kashou... Mmn...」
Kashou: 「...Huh?」
Azuki: 「Mm... Lick, mnph... smooch, shlurp... Mmn...」
Her tiny hands grab hold of mine...
...And her quivering tongue shyly coils around my fingers.
Kashou: 「A-Azuki...? Wait... Uh... Huh...?」
Azuki: 「Shlurp, lick... shmoosh, haahn... Lick, slurp, shlp...」
Azuki: 「Haah... It's sweet... Ngh, lick... Shlurrrp, mlem, mlem...」
Her petite tongue explores my fingers...
...As she laps up the custard from them.
Azuki: 「Hmh, lick... Mm, shlurp, lick.... Mm, smch...」
Azuki: 「M-My mouth... Wow, I... Haah, lick, smch...」
Azuki: 「I'm... shivering... Why am I shivering? Hmh, drool...」
Azuki's feverish expression...
...And this sensation is slimy and tingly.
I feel the warmth of her tongue on my fingers.
...Damn, this is way too erotic.
I find myself completely unable to move in this situation.
Azuki: 「Haah, ah... Ngh, nghhh... Mm, shlurp, smmch... Mmn~ ♪」
Azuki: 「Drool, shulph... Mm, hah... Smmch, shlurp~ ♪」
Azuki: 「Th-The base of your fingers, lick... and the palm of your hand... Haah, they're so sweet~ ♪」
Her tongue crawls from my fingertips to my palm, and then to the back of my hand...
...So absolutely gently.
The slightly rough texture of her tongue feels amazing.
An electrifying pulse shoots through my body.
Azuki: 「I've always thought that... your fingers are so... slender and beautiful, Kashou...」
Azuki: 「When you bake a cake... shlurp, and when you pet me...」
Azuki: 「These hands... Haah, mmn~ ♪ I love... them... Shlurp, nom, sluuuurp~ ♪」
It's as if she was fellating my fingers.
Her tongue wraps around them, and she slurps and sucks noisily.
Kashou: 「Gah...! A-Azuki...!」
A moan spills out of my mouth at this unexpectedly pleasurable sensation.
Azuki: 「...Ah!」
Azuki: 「Um, ah...! E-Er, I-I...!」
Azuki: 「S-Sorry...! I guess, um, I-I got carried away...!」
Kashou: 「Oh, it's okay, it's nothing you should apologize for...」
Kashou: 「...I was just... a little surprised.」
Azuki: 「Huh? Surprised by what...?」
Azuki: 「You told me to try some, so why are you so surprised...?」
Kashou: 「Huh? I didn't mean I wanted you to lick my fingers, just...」
Kashou: 「I thought you would use a spoon or something to try it...」
Kashou: 「I never thought you would lick it straight off my hand, Azuki...」
Azuki: 「Huh...? Y-You thought I'd use a spoon...?」
Azuki: 「So, you're saying... that I completely misunderstood you...?」
Azuki: 「...!!」
Azuki: 「W-Wait a sec...!!」
Azuki: 「...!! ....Grrr~!!」
She turns her back to me and clings to the refrigerator.
I guess even Azuki can make mistakes sometimes.
She pounds against the refrigerator door while muttering under her breath.
Kashou: 「Uh... Well, um... You know...?」
Kashou: 「I mean, um... I don't really mind...? We are, uh, family, right...?」
Azuki: 「The way... you're tryin' to make me console me... just hurts...」
Azuki: 「Waaaaaaaauuugh...!!!」
Azuki: 「Why? Why couldn't I keep my cool...?!」
Azuki: 「Dammit... Dammit...!!」
Azuki: 「I'm better off dead! That was so damn stupid of me...!!!」
She flings her curses at the refrigerator as she leans against it.
...Well, I'll leave her be for now.
I try to ignore the scene in front of me.
Azuki: 「It's... It's your fault too, Kashou!」
Azuki: 「A-Anyone would make the same mistake in that situation!!」
Azuki: 「Pretend it didn't happen! I'm beggin' you! Ugh, just let me dieeeeeee!!」
Kashou: 「Enough, Azuki! Go take a breather and calm down!!」
Kashou: 「It's not a big deal, Azuki, but you need to calm down a bit, alright?!」
I give her some alone time.
Azuki: 「...」
Azuki: 「Mm... Hmm...?」
Azuki: 「...?」
Azuki: 「Ah! I-It's dark out?!」
Kashou: 「Oh, sorry, Azuki. Did I wake you up?」
Azuki: 「Huh? K-Kashou...?」
Azuki: 「I-I'm sorry...! I was noddin' off and fell asleep...!」
Azuki: 「Wh-What time is it? It's already dark outside...」
Kashou: 「Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine, just sleep.」
She jumps up to her feet, and I try to calm her down.
Kashou: 「It's 10:00 p.m. The cafe's closed, and everyone else has already gone home. Relax.」
Azuki: 「10:00 p.m...」
Kashou: 「I went looking for you after you never came back from your break...」
Kashou: 「I found you fast asleep in my bed, and you wouldn't wake up.」
Kashou: 「I figured you must have been exhausted, so I just let you sleep.」
Kashou: 「I had Vanilla change you into something a bit more comfortable, though. You didn't look too comfy sleeping in your uniform.」
Azuki: 「Sigh... So that's what happened, huh...?」
Azuki: 「I'm sorry that I didn't wake up... Haah...」
She hides her face in her hand...
...And her shoulders droop as she sighs.
Kashou: 「Don't worry about it. It's not like it happens often.」
Kashou: 「You're the eldest catgirl, so you're under a lot of stress having to look after everyone, right? Even you need a break sometimes.」
Kashou: 「I've said it before, but...」
Kashou: 「...You're always such a big help, Azuki.」
Kashou: 「If you're not feeling well sometimes, just let me know, okay?」
Kashou: 「We're buds, right?」
I sit down on the bed...
...And ruffle Azuki's hair.
Azuki: 「No, I'm seriously okay here...」
Azuki: 「I mean, I guess I was a bit sleep deprived, but...」
Azuki: 「............」
Her words trail off before she can finish her sentence.
Her lips are pursed together as if she wants to tell me something, though.
She squeezes the blanket tightly with her hands...
...But doesn't seem to cheer up at all.
Worried, I gaze at her.
Kashou: 「Azuki? What's wrong?」
Azuki: 「...You're always lookin' out for me, Kashou.」
Azuki: 「I'd rather you not worry about me, so I'll just come out and say it...」
She nods...
...And turns her bright red face towards me.
Azuki: 「...I saw what you were up to yesterday.」
Kashou: 「Yesterday...」
Kashou: 「...Yesterday?」
Azuki: 「Yeah, uh... You know, with Nuts and Chocola...」
Azuki: 「...You know... this and... err... that...」
Kashou: 「Yeah... Uhh... that, right...」
Now I get it.
Things suddenly get a bit awkward, and I instinctively avert my gaze.
Azuki: 「I wasn't tryin' to peep on you guys or anything like that...」
Azuki: 「That Nuts is just always such a dumb catgirl, so I got worried...」
Azuki: 「I went back to the shop, and... uh... you know...」
Kashou: 「I see...」
...So it wasn't just Chocola who discovered us.
If even Azuki saw us...
...I guess we really weren't paying attention, huh.
Well, the cat's out of the bag now.
Azuki: 「I mean, it was really embarrassing, but...」
Azuki: 「...You looked so gentle... and manly...」
Azuki: 「...I usually never see that side of you.」
Azuki: 「And... now that I've seen you like that... Um, I don't know if I can look at you the same way...」
Azuki: 「So it's not like I'm feelin' sick or anything...」
She blushes bright red as she looks straight at the ground...
...And her hands fiddle with the hem of the blanket.
Kashou: 「Hmm... It's... umm, uhhh...」
Kashou: 「...I'm sorry.」
Azuki: 「H-Hey, you got nothin' to apologize for...!」
Azuki: 「I'm the one who accidentally saw you guys, uhh...」
Azuki: 「W-Well, I mean, I guess I've gotten a bit weird after that, but...」
Azuki: 「...I didn't... mean to make you worry about me... Haaah...」
She crosses her arms tightly across her chest...
...And lets out a sensual sigh.
I always considered Azuki to be a catgirl who wasn't afraid to speak her mind or tell dirty jokes.
I've never seen her look so embarrassed...
...It's actually a bit cute.
...And now I'm shamelessly checking her out...
Azuki: 「W-Well... Now you know...」
Azuki: 「I'd prefer it if you didn't worry about me and just left me alone...」
Kashou: 「A-Alright... If that's what you want...」
Our eyes meet awkwardly.
Vanilla: 「Is everything okay, Master?」
Kashou: 「Yeah, it's nothing big, Vanilla. Don't worry about it.」
Kashou: 「What's Chocola up to?」
Vanilla: 「She went to take a bath.」
Vanilla: 「She's probably taking off her panties right about now.」
Kashou: 「I don't need to know that much, Vanilla.」
Vanilla: 「Chocola had a lot fun yesterday, so she's all worn out now.」
Kashou: 「Worn out?」
Vanilla: 「Now, now, Master, it's not something you should worry about」
Vanilla: 「Anyway, how is Azuki feeling?」
Azuki: 「F-Fine. Nothin' my little sister needs to worry about.」
Azuki: 「But sorry you had to change my uniform, though, Vanilla.」
Vanilla: 「Oh no, it was nothing.」
Vanilla: 「Are you really okay, though, Azuki?」
Azuki: 「I-I told you, I'm fine...」
Azuki averts her gaze as Vanilla continues to interrogate her.
Vanilla: 「What's wrong? Why did you look away?」
Azuki: 「Nothin'. Nothin' at all...」
Kashou: 「...」
...I recognize that look. Vanilla's scheming something.
She's grinning like a madcat.
Azuki looks a bit awkward, too...
...What's going on?
I observe the two catgirls before me as I try to figure it out.
Azuki: 「I-I'm fine, okay? Go away already.」
Azuki: 「I'm sorry you guys had to pick up my slack today.」
Azuki: 「Anyway, I'm gonna--」
Vanilla: 「Hold it right there.」
Vanilla grabs Azuki's hand and pulls her back.
Azuki: 「Wh-What's with you...? I said I'm fine...」
Vanilla: 「Azuki, the truth is that your heart hurts, right?」
Vanilla brings her face close to Azuki's...
...And almost immediately, Azuki backs away from Vanilla.
But Azuki can't escape Vanilla's iron claw.
Azuki: 「M-My heart...? What... I'm not...」
Vanilla: 「If you're not going to be honest, I'll tell Master myself.」
Azuki: 「Wha...?!」
Azuki flinches upon hearing Vanilla's threat.
Kashou: 「...What are you talking about, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Teehee, just hold on a moment, Master.」
Vanilla: 「Right, Azuki? The truth is that you don't want to go home tonight.」
With a sadistic smile...
...Vanilla wraps her arms around Azuki from behind.
Azuki: 「Wh-What do you mean you're gonna tell him...?!」
Vanilla: 「You know exactly what I'll tell him, don't you?」
Vanilla: 「I'm the one who helped you get changed, am I not? Teehee~」
Azuki: 「...Grrr~!!」
Azuki: 「Even if... I can't just...!」
Azuki: 「What do you expect me to do...?!」
Vanilla brings her face toward the shaken Azuki...
...And presses her lips against the nape of her neck.
