Chocola&Vanilla: 「7 pm!  Cleanup time!」
Chocola: 「Heheh~ Master liked the curry Chocola made~! ♪」
Vanilla: 「That's great, Chocola. When you're happy, I'm happy too.」
Maple: 「It's definitely like Chocola to think she made the curry herself when all she did was peel the carrots.」
Azuki: 「What a huuuge difference compared to a certain feisty American Curl here, huh Maple?」
Maple: 「Huuhhh? You wanna go? You wanna fight again?」
Azuki: 「Oh? We really doin' this? I'll eat you for dessert!」
Cinnamon: 「Kashou-san sure does seem busy lately, though...」
Coconut: 「Yeah. I hardly ever see him relaxing at home nowadays.」
Cinnamon: 「Maybe he's got himself a girlfrien--」
Shigure: 「No!! Unthinkable!! Impossible...!!」
Coconut: 「Shi-Shigure-sama?! What happened, are you alright...?!」
Shigure: 「Nii-sama... with a girlfriend... The catgirls in our house are one thing, but for Nii-sama to be with another woman? I...」
Azuki: 「H-Hey, Shigure, you okay...? You've gone blue in the face...」
Coconut: 「Cinnamon, how could you say such a thing?! You should know better than to say something so thoughtless when Shigure-sama is right here!」
Cinnamon: 「I-I'm sorry! The words just slipped right out...!」
Shigure: 「He can't be...! He already has such a wonderful, lovable little sister like me, and such gifted, amazing catgirls here by his side...!」
Shigure: 「Ah, I know! All things must pass -- nothing lasts forever... Even if he has a girlfriend, they might break up...」
Shigure: 「Even though his lover may someday leave him, I, his little sister by blood, will be with him forever!」
Shigure: 「It should be possible to speed up their breakup slightly... No, it's most definitely possible... Yes! With the right means, I...」
Shigure: 「I know, I could 'arrange' for her to receive certain images of me...!!」
Maple: 「I'm pretty sure pictures of his little sister aren't going to do anything.」
Shigure: 「Maple! Whose side are you on?! I'm not going to buy you that iPon anymore!!」
Maple: 「Noooooo!! This is unjust! I'm being oppressed!」
Maple: 「Wh-Why don't you just send pictures of Cinnamon's pride and joy boobs instead! That'll get you a better result, right?!」
Cinnamon: 「No way, meowwww! That's too much! I can't possibly have such embarrassing pictures of my body floating around the sea of the internet for all eternity~!!」
Cinnamon: 「What about photos of Azu-chan? She doesn't look legal at all! That ought to work!」
Azuki: 「Not legal?!' What the hell do 'ya mean by that, huh?! I'm older than you are, you booby-cat!」
Shigure: 「No, no, that won't work. Besides, Azuki and I aren't all that different size-wise.」
Azuki: 「Wh-Why you...! You've never said that before, but you've been secretly thinking that the entire time?!」
Shigure: 「We might as well send fake photos of both Cinnamon and Coconut being lewd together, then...!」
Coconut: 「Waahhh! I don't even have anything to do with this! That's terrible, Shigure-sama!」
Vanilla: 「Hmm, it's turned into utter chaos here. People sure are scary when they're panicked.」
Vanilla: 「... Oh? Chocola? Where did she go...?」
Vanilla: 「D-Don't tell me...! Did Chocola run out of the house in shock...?!」
Chocola: 「Master said he doesn't have a girlfriend! Yaaay, that's great~! ♪」
Shigure: 「Ohh...! While I was agonizing over all the painful possibilities, you bravely went forth and opened that Pandora's box without a second thought! Chocola, you are truly amazing...!」
Vanilla: 「I expect no less from Chocola. The innocence and straightforwardness of her actions are truly unparalleled.」
Vanilla: 「Well, anyway, I guess that's that.」
Azuki: 「Shigure... So that's what she really thought of me... I can't let my guard down, even around my own owner... Grumble grumble...」
Cinnamon: 「No matter how much of a masochist I am, I have limits... I don't want sadism without love...」
Coconut: 「I never thought this would turn into something so serious... I've even sworn my loyalty to her... My loyalty!」
Maple: 「Taking away the iPon she promised me for just soiling her mood... I need to be more careful next time something like this happens...」
Vanilla: 「... Ohh, all the catgirls seemed to have been quite shaken up by this incident.」
Chocola: 「Hm? What's with the sullen mood here? You said something about shakes?」
Vanilla: 「Ah, Chocola, you're wonderful. Stay like that forever.」
Chocola: 「Hm? Hmm~? I don't really get it, but don't worry! Chocola is always perky, one-hundred-per-cent! ♪」
Vanilla: 「Right you are. Right you are.」
Vanilla: 「Come on, let's clean up. Everyone will snap out of their mood sooner or later.」
Chocola: 「Alrighty~! Chocola will help out! ♪」
