Coconut&Maple: 「8 pm, watching TV.」
Chocola: 「Vanilla, look! Look at the TV! It's an elephant! An elephant!」
Chocola: 「Ahahaha! It's so big! Like, waaaaaaay big! And its nose is soooooo long! Toot toot~!」
Vanilla: 「Yes, 'toot toot' indeed. What gentle eyes they have, too. They're really wrinkled and rugged though.」
Azuki: 「Yeahhh! The Savannah is totally wicked...! It really gets my catgirl blood boilin'!」
Azuki: 「Go! Go cheetah! Take that gazelle out in one blow! Yeeaaahhhh!!」
Cinnamon: 「It's so wide open and full of scary animals. I don't think I could survive in a place like that...」
Cinnamon: 「I'm so glad I'm the Minadzuki family's catgirl」
Coconut: 「Still, I'd love to really give my legs a good stretch there someday. I'm sure it'd feel great.」
Shigure: 「Well, we should go for a trip together sometime then. I've heard of tours around the Savannah where you can go wildlife watching.」
Maple: 「I don't want to go someplace without any reception! If we're travelling, let's go to Hawaii or Las Vegas instead.」
Chocola: 「Oh, now it's sea animals on TV! It's a killer whale! Look, Vanilla, it's your favorite!」
Vanilla: 「Ohhh! Killer whales are way, way cool!」
Vanilla: 「I wonder if any whales'll show up? Like, a blue whale...! I want to see one on a NekoNama livecast one day...!」
Azuki: 「Ohh, next is fish -- a special on fish.」
Cinnamon: 「The bluefin tuna is so biiiig~ It looks so delicious~ ♪」
Coconut: 「The school of pilchards look so beautiful and tasty too. If we were there, it'd practically be all-you-can-eat!」
Maple: 「Eating freshly caught, raw fish sounds absolutely lovely!」
Chocola: 「hey say you can actually eat Mola Mola. Does it taste yummy?」
Vanilla: 「Apparently it's pretty easy to buy down south. I'd like to try what it tastes like one day.」
Shigure: 「Hmm, I guess catgirls only see fish as food, huh?」
Shigure: 「Come on now, we should get in the bath so TV time is over!」
All: 「Okaaaaay~」
