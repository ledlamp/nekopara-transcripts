Chocola&Vanilla: 「8 am! Rise and shine!」
Shigure: 「Chocola, Vanilla, it's morning! Time to get up!」
Chocola: 「Huh...? Shigure-chan...? Morning already?」
Vanilla: 「Uhnnghh...  Over... my dead body... Zzz...」
Shigure: 「Gosh, you two really are just kittens, aren't you. You two sure are a handful!」
Shigure: 「--Minaduki Special Wake-Up Technique, Number 32: Insatiable Itch!」
Shigure: 「Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle!」
Chocola&Vanilla: 「Myahahahah! Hahahahahahahah!!」
Shigure: 「Take this! Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle~!」
Chocola&Vanilla: 「Myaahh!! Hahahah! Aheehee! Ahahahahahhahahahah!!!」
Chocola: 「Master! It's morning, it's morning~!」
Vanilla: 「Huh? Master isn't here. That wakeup technique I just learned is all for naught.」
Shigure: 「Oh? Maybe he's practicing his baking again?」
Shigure: 「Which means that both mother and father are out... So it's just me and the catgirls in the house today.」
Chocola: 「Oh my! That must mean we're in charge of our own meals for today, huh?」
Vanilla: 「If worse comes to worst, we won't die from just one day of not eating, anyway.」
Shigure: 「Sigh~ Recently, Nii-sama isn't spending much time with me, so not getting my daily dose of him is leaving me quite unsatisfied~」
Chocola: 「Oh! 'Unsatisfied!' Chocola knows that! It's that pervy thing! Shigure-chan, you sure are such a perv so early in the morning!」
Shigure: 「Teehee, I don't think so! This is normal for a little sister! Hmph!」
Vanilla: 「Master's futon is still warm though. It seems like he didn't leave that long ago.」
Chocola: 「Let's see here... Hmm... You're right, it's warm and smells like Master, meow~ ♪」
Shigure: 「Sniff sniff, sniff sniff. This is indeed Nii-sama's fresh and spicy scent! ♪」
Shigure: 「It makes me want to turn it into a perfume and keep it all to myself! Hoho, ohohohoh!!」
Vanilla: 「Don't leave me out here, I'll get under the futon too! Nuzzle nuzzle」
Chocola: 「Meow! Chocola has the pillow, Shigure-chan! The pillow is Chocola's!」
Shigure: 「Teehee, how naïve, Chocola! You still don't know the grandeur of sheets!」
Shigure: 「Let's switch these out for a new ones later.」
Vanilla: 「Mmm... Master's futon is quite comfortable... It sure makes me sleepy...」
Chocola: 「Now that you mention it... Dreamland is calling for Chocola to come back...」
Shigure: 「Nii-sama's devilish scent... has... that... effect...」
Chocola&Vanilla&Shigure: 「Zzz... Zzz...」
