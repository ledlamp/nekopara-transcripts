Chocola&Vanilla: 「11 am! Emergency cleanup!」
Chocola: 「Cleaning time~ Cleaning time~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Our orders for today are to the clean the hallways. It's kind of a pain, but let's do our best.」
Azuki: 「What the... What the hell is this thing?」
Maple: 「It's the first time I've seen it too...」
Coconut: 「It's not something dangerous, right? 'Cause if it was, it wouldn't be just sitting around here in the open...」
Cinnamon: 「The fact that it's placed on the wall means it's some kind of decoration, right~?」
Vanilla: 「Catgirls detected up ahead. Judging by their location, most likely in the bathroom. What're they doing?」
Chocola: 「Oh, Chocola has heard about this, they're going together to pee! It's something girls do! Chocola bets that's it!」
Vanilla: 「It's cute that you know such inappropriate things, Chocola... Such a good girl. Just stay like that forever, okay?」
Coconut: 「Ah, Chocola, Vanilla.」
Azuki: 「Hey, you two! Any idea what this thing is?」
Chocola: 「This? What... is this? No clue here!」
Maple: 「I don't think it was here yesterday.」
Cinnamon: 「N-No way! There's a hidden camera in the Minaduki household...?!」
Azuki: 「Don't be stupid! If there really was one, then Maple's naked bathroom show would be out there for the world to see!」
Maple: 「Mreowww!! Don't just bring up the past like that! I can go to the bathroom only half-naked now!」
Vanilla: 「In any case, the Minaduki catgirls' dignities are at stake here. This is an emergency.」
Chocola: 「Myah?! It just sprayed something out, like whoosh!」
Vanilla: 「... Sniff sniff, sniff sniff. Hmm... Something smells good, sniff.」
Cinnamon: 「Meow~ That's right! It smells great! Sniff sniff~」
Maple: 「Oh, maybe this is that thing I saw on TV! It was some kind of automatic aroma sprayer or something?」
Coconut: 「Yeah-- I mean, why yes, I've seen it too! It sprays at certain times, or whenever someone passes by, apparently!」
Azuki: 「Is that so~ Definitely something for the civilized, ain't it? Basically, it makes sure your bathroom always smells nice, huh?」
Chocola: 「Ohh! It sprayed again! Amazing, it's so convenient!」
Azuki: 「Pretty damn cool! Whoever came up with this is a real genius.」
Maple: 「Hm, I wonder how it works?」
Vanilla: 「Ah, if you look into it like that, it'll--」
Azuki&Maple: 「Myaaaaghhhaaahhhh!!!」
Azuki: 「My eyes! My eyes! I can't see!! Gaaahhh, it stings... It freakin' stings...!!」
Maple: 「Mreowww...!! My nose! It went straight into my nose! It burns... It burns so much, myaaahhh!!」
Vanilla: 「I told you so...」
Coconut: 「It sprays automatically, so isn't it common sense not to put your face right in front of it?」
Cinnamon: 「Anyways, we need to wash it out! Azu-chan, can you take my hand~?」
Azuki: 「I owe 'ya, Cinnamon! I'll never forget this, at least until after I wash my eyes out!」
Chocola: 「Ah, Azuki-chan, that's not Cinnamon-chan's hand, that's the button for the bidet--」
Coconut&Cinnamon: 「Meowwwrrrggghhhh!!!」
Chocola: 「Wow, what a series of events! Things are getting pretty out of hand...!!」
Vanilla: 「Ah, the downward spiral of sadness. There's nothing we can do about this.」
Coconut: 「Huhhh?! That's so mean! What am I supposed to do, then? Fweehh!!」
Cinnamon: 「I can't see, I can't seeee~! Where's the towel? It should be on the top of the shelf--!」
Vanilla: 「Cinnamon, that's not the towel, that's all the toilet paper we just--」
Cinnamon: 「Mreowwww! The toilet paper's all over me~! ♪」
Chocola: 「Oh no, meow! The toilet paper's unrolling all over the hallwaaay!」
Vanilla: 「It's just like a red carpet, slowly unrolling. There's no stopping the spiral into sadness now.」
Shigure: 「What's this about a 'spiral' now?」
Chocola: 「Wha--?! Sh-Shigure-chan?!」
Vanilla: 「Sh-Shigure?!」
Shigure: 「And here I thought you all were actually cleaning up properly... Just what is going on?」
Azuki: 「I-It ain't what 'ya think, Shigure...! 'What's not what' you think? Well, uh... A lot of it...!」
Maple: 「Yes, it's nothing to get angry over or anything, okay? There were, um, some circumstances that got out of control...!」
Coconut: 「Fweehhh... Shigure, your smile's scaring me! I didn't even do anything...!」
Cinnamon: 「Haahh, haahhh... ♪ Being tied up with toilet paper feels pretty... Haa haa haa~♪」
Shigure: 「I would have never thought I'd see such a shameful sight with all the Minaduki catgirls involved...」
Shigure: 「Everyone, just clean up for now, alright? We can save the punishment for later!」
All: 「Yes... We're sorry...」
