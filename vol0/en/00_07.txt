Chocola&Shigure: 「2 pm, going out!」
Chocola: 「Time for a walk, time for a walk~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「It feels great to be outside, right? You're so cute when you're this happy, Chocola.」
Chocola: 「Master hasn't been taking us out for walks recently though, meow...」
Shigure: 「Right? He doesn't even look after me, either. Oh Nii-sama, what shall I do with you...? Sigh~」
Maple: 「What's he baking all those cakes for anyways? Even his parents are getting pretty upset about it.」
Azuki: 「Wasn't it so he could open a patisserie? So that's why he's been secretly kneading it by himself, right?」
Cinnamon: 「'Kneading it?!' You mean, like, kneading IT?! Doing it... by himself? Meowww...! ♪」
Cinnamon: 「Oh, Master Kashou, if you were that troubled, then Cinnamon... ♪ Cinnamon would looooove to be your assistant~ ♪」
Coconut: 「Cinnamon, we're outside. Show some restraint.」
Shigure: 「Exactly! And if he needs an assistant, then it is only right that I, his little sister, am the one to fill that role! ♪」
Coconut: 「Shigure-sama, please show some restraint as well!」
Maple: 「This is a new addition to my list of recommended cafés!」
Maple: 「At this time of day, I suggest the cake set. Should we go with one order each?」
Cinnamon: 「Wow! ♪ May-chan, you sure know a lot of fancy places, don't you~! ♪」
Coconut: 「Yes, this coffee shop sure does have a nice, quiet ambiance to it.」
Shigure: 「Nothing less from one of my catgirls! You have such an eye for things!」
Chocola: 「Latte art! Look, Vanilla, they can do latte art here!」
Vanilla: 「Latte art...? What does that look like? I want to try one.」
Maple: 「Teehee, I thought you'd say that so I already ordered a few!」
Maple: 「Oh, and here they are! Have a look for yourself.」
Chocola: 「Wooow! It's Chocola! Look, it's a latte art of Chocola! Amazing!」
Vanilla: 「And this one is of me...! Incredible! This is... this is a masterpiece!」
Maple: 「Heheh... As your elder catgirl, I've got to treat you two young'ins sometimes!」
Coconut: 「Um, uhh... Maple... Could I... you know...」
Maple: 「Teehee, don't worry! I thought you'd be interested too. There's one for you as well!」
Maple: 「See, here it is!」
Coconut: 「Whoa, it's me! I'm on the coffee! Maple, you're such a nice catgirl! I'm so happy, thanks!」
Maple: 「Ahaha, you sure are excited! You're still very much a kitten, aren't you!」
Azuki: 「I guess even an overbearing American Curl like you's got your good points!」
Shigure: 「Oh? Maple is such a sweet catgirl though...」
Cinnamon: 「I think that Maple's a good girl too~ ♪」
Maple: 「My my, so much praise for just this...」
Maple: 「Well, latte art is all fine and good, but this is coffee after all! We ought to drink it while it's still hot, no?」
Maple: 「This café has some fantastic coffee, so make sure to savour it!」
Chocola&Vanilla&Coconut: 「We will! Bon nyappétit!」
