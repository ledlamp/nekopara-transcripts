Chocola&Vanilla: 「10 pm! Bedtime!」
Shigure: 「Already 10 pm, huh? Chocola, Vanilla?」
Chocola: 「Yeah?」
Vanilla: 「Yes?」
Shigure: 「The other catgirls have already retired for the night, so you two should probably do the same and get some rest.」
Chocola: 「Mhmm~ Can't we stay here for a bit longer?」
Shigure: 「I don't really mind if you do, but... Is something the matter?」
Chocola: 「Nothing, really, it's just...」
Vanilla: 「Apparently, she's been feeling lonely because Master hasn't been spending much time with her.」
Chocola: 「Mreowww!! It's not funny, Chocola is serious, meow!」
Shigure: 「Teehee, is that what's wrong, Chocola?」
Chocola: 「Meoww... I mean, it's already this late and Master's still in the kitchen baking cakes...」
Vanilla: 「She does have a point. He certainly isn't playing with us anymore... It's like he's ignoring us.」
Shigure: 「I'm sure Nii-sama has his own reasons for this.」
Shigure: 「As his family, we've ought to try to understand him.」
Chocola: 「Chocola is trying to, but...」
Vanilla: 「It just doesn't sit well with her.」
Shigure: 「Mhmm!  As someone who also loves Nii-sama, I can definitely understand your feelings.」
Shigure: 「Well then, would you like to sleep here with me tonight instead?」
Vanilla: 「Oh, you're so kindhearted, Shigure. I'll be sleeping here too, then!」
Shigure: 「Oh, of course! The bed is plenty wide for all three of us.」
Chocola: 「Yaaaay, alright! ♪ Chocola loves Shigure-channnn! ♪ Glomp~」
Vanilla: 「I love you too, Shigure. Glomp.」
Shigure: 「Come on, you two, I'm going to be crushed if you keep hugging me like that!」
Shigure: 「Anyway, I'm going to turn off the lights now. Time to get in bed, you two.」
Chocola&Vanilla: 「Okaaaay~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Hey, Shigure-chan! Shigure-chan!」
Chocola: 「Can you tell us some stories of when Master was still little? Just until we get sleepy, meow.」
Shigure: 「Teehee, so this was the real goal, huh?」
Shigure: 「You just love old stories about Nii-sama, don't you, Chocola?」
Vanilla: 「I'm also curious... about what Master was like as a child.」
Shigure: 「There's quite an age gap between Nii-sama and I, so I'm not too knowledgeable on his childhood.」
Shigure: 「But I think it's because of that age gap that he treats me so lovingly. Now I'm stuck in this bind, teehee~」
Chocola: 「Bind?」
Vanilla: 「She means being tied up. Probably.」
Shigure: 「Well, that is another way of reading it, I suppose.」
Shigure: 「Now then, what story should I start with? There's so many to choose from--」
Coconut: 「Ahah, I knew it! You two really were still in Shigure-sama's room!」
Coconut: 「I thought it was strange when I couldn't hear the two of you chatting from inside your room.」
Cinnamon: 「See? I told you they were in Shigure-chan's room. I was sure they were here~」
Chocola: 「Oh, Coco-chan, Cinna-chan!」
Azuki: 「Why'd you follow me, Maple? Too scared to sleep alone?」
Maple: 「Of course not! It looked like everyone was coming here so I just kind of went along! That's it, okay?!」
Maple: 「And besides, what are YOU doing here?」
Azuki: 「It smelled like somethin' fun was gonna happen. Same reason as you, basically.」
Vanilla: 「Azuki, and Maple too.」
Shigure: 「Oh my, oh my~ Everyone came back, teehee!」
Coconut: 「It's not fair that only Chocola and Vanilla get to sleep together with you, Shigure-sama!」
Cinnamon: 「That's right, no cuddling without us~ I want to sleep together with Shigure-chan too~!」
Maple: 「I really don't care about that, but there's no way you're going to leave me out of this!」
Azuki: 「If you're gonna have some fun, then you better lemme join in!」
Shigure: 「Fufuh, let's all sleep together then.」
Chocola: 「Yaaaay! Sleepover! That's a great idea!」
Vanilla: 「Sleeping together will be great. I'm very excited.」
Coconut: 「I'm coming in then!」
Cinnamon: 「Excuse me~ ♪」
Cinnamon: 「Ah, Chocola-chan, could you scoot over a bit?」
Chocola: 「Oh, okay!」
Shigure: 「Huh? Wait...! Everyone squeezing into just one bed is...」
Maple: 「Azuki, move over a little more, I can't get on the bed like this.」
Azuki: 「Even if you tell me to, I'm kinda at my limit here. Vanilla, could you move over thadda way?」
Vanilla: 「I'm already quite tightly compressed. I can't go any farther than this.」
Shigure: 「W-Wait... This is getting a little too cramped...」
Chocola: 「What about if we all lied on our sides and hugged each other?」
Vanilla: 「Nice idea, Chocola. A brilliant space-saving trick.」
Shigure: 「Guhhh...! S-Stop, the pressure from both sides is...!」
Maple: 「Well, if we go by body size, Coconut should hug Azuki. That ought to fix things!」
Coconut: 「No way! Azuki thrashes around like crazy in her sleep. You hug Azuki instead!」
Azuki: 「Hey, what's that you're sayin' 'bout me?!  And if you think I'm gonna let you suffocate me with those huge knockers, then you've got another thing coming!」
Cinnamon: 「Too bad, I guess I'm also out of the question too then, huh? Eheheh~」
Shigure: 「S-Seven people on one bed...! This is waaaay too cramped! There's no way we can sleep like thisssss!!」
All: 「Zzz... Zzz...」
