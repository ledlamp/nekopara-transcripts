Chocola: 「Master, Chocola is ready to make this delivery~!  Please double-check the order!」
Kashou: 「Roger, give me a sec!」
Kashou: 「Let's see, two shortcakes, two cheesecakes, two fruit tarts...」
Chocola: 「Fidget fidget fidget~」
Kashou: 「... one gateau, one millie-feuille, one montblanc...」
Chocola: 「Twitch twitch twitch~」
Kashou: 「Yep, it's the same as the sales invoice.」
Chocola: 「Yay~! Chocola wants a reward, then! Pet her, pet her!!」
Kashou: 「Okay, okay. Pat pat...」
Kashou: 「Okay then, be careful of cars and people and come back safe and sound!」
Chocola: 「Okay~ I'm off~!」
Chocola: 「Ah, you're forgetting something though, Master!」
Kashou: 「Hm? Forgot what? There's nothing els--」
Chocola: 「I'll be off, mwah! ♪」
Kashou: 「Ch-Chocola...?!」
Chocola: 「Eheheh! ♪ Master is super cute when he's embarrassed~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Cute...?! Look, we can't be doing that in the bakery...!」
Chocola: 「After all, Chocola is Master's partner and catpanion! ♪」
Chocola: 「I'll be careful on my way out~!」
Kashou: 「Ah, Chocola...!」
Kashou: 「......」
Female Customer A: 「Ohh, I see~ So Chocola-chan is the owner's catpanion?」
Kashou: 「Huh? Ah, no...」
Kashou: 「Well... you could say she was... so, uhm, yes...」
Female Customer B: 「Just look how cute and honest she is, of course you'd be interested in her! Ahaha!」
Kashou: 「Well, uhm... I'm sorry, could we stop with this, please...」
Female Customer A: 「Ahaha, you really don't have to be so embarrassed about it!」
Female Customer A: 「It's not that uncommon to have a catgirl as your partner nowadays.」
Female Customer B: 「Judging from your reaction, was it recent? Her becoming your catpanion, I mean.」
Kashou: 「I'm sorry, I'm not that good with these types of conversations, so I'd appreciate it if...」
Female Customer A: 「It's pretty rare to see you blushing like this, Mr. Owner~ ♪」
Female Customer B: 「If that's the case, then I'll have another black tea, so please do tell me all about it~ ♪」
Kashou: 「I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of work...」
Vanilla: 「Stare...」
Kashou: 「... Phew, they finally left.」
We had a brief pause after those guests left.
... I'm not very good at talking about my romantic affairs like that.
After all, since I was young, the only thing I've done has been making Japanese sweets.
I was exhausted from trying to figure out how to respond to them.
Vanilla: 「Master. I've finished closing out the register. Come check.」
Kashou: 「Yeah, got it! Thanks!」
Vanilla: 「Stare...」
Kashou: 「... What are you so angry about, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「I'm not angry. If it looks that way, then Master should know why.」
Kashou: 「I don't know why, so that's why I'm asking.」
Kashou: 「Ah, are you hungry or something?」
Kashou: 「If you are, you can have a slice of cake.」
Vanilla: 「Who do you think I am, Master? I'm not Chocola.」
Kashou: 「And just why are you bringing up Chocola?」
She doesn't really get upset often.
Aside from her desperately yelling "I'm hungry!" sometimes.
Vanilla: 「If you must know, it's because of how you keep ogling the customers with those lecherous eyes of yours. Totally sleeeeeazy.」
Kashou: 「Hey, that's a false accusation! Just when was I ogling them?」
Vanilla: 「I can't let my guard down while Chocola is out on delivery.」
Vanilla: 「For you to think that sleeping with a catgirl once makes her all yours...」
Vanilla: 「I never thought Master would ever be such a horny pastry puffer. Humph!」
Vanilla folded her arms and snorted.
A horny pastry puffer, she says?
There was an unpleasant sound to those words.
Vanilla: 「First off, you're acting so flirty even though us catgirls are here.」
Kashou: 「I got it, I got it. I'm not flirting, so it's okay.」
Kashou: 「Actually, I'm really not very good at stuff like that.」
Vanilla: 「I don't sense any sincerity in your closing statement. Thumbs down.」
Kashou: 「It's just a misunderstanding! Don't be mad.」
Vanilla: 「I'm not angry. I'm an always cool and collected catgirl, just like Shigure says.」
Vanilla: 「You not only ignored me, but you did this and that with Chocola AND you're just playing with her feelings. I just can't stand for this, hmph!」
Isn't "hmph" an angry sound, though...
It was a false accusation to say I was fooling around with Chocola.
Hmmm, once I put everything Vanilla is saying together, it sure seems like...
Kashou: 「... You're jealous, huh.」
Kashou: 「Sorry. I'll be more careful next time.」
Vanilla: 「I'm not jealous. Just expressing my honest opinion.」
Kashou: 「I got it, I got it. I'm sorry. I'll act with more restraint.」
Vanilla: 「You make it sound like doing that would be a hassle.」
Kashou: 「I got it, okay. There, there.」
Vanilla puffed out her cheeks as I patted her on the head.
Even Vanilla gets jealous, huh.
I thought she was more carefree than this though.
I guess it's to be expected, since despite being always together, Chocola hasn't been paying much attention to her recently.
I need to be more careful as their owner.
Kashou: 「Come to think of it...」
Vanilla: 「What?」
Kashou: 「Are you in heat yet, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Pervert.」
Kashou: 「No, no, that's not what I mean. I'm just concerned about your physical health, okay?」
Vanilla: 「Pervert! Lecher! Horny pastry puffer!」
Kashou: 「... Well, I guess you're doing fine then.」
... I really was honestly worried, though.
Vanilla leveled a chilly glare at me while I was thinking that.
Kashou: 「Hey Chocola, mind watching the store for a bit?」
Chocola: 「Okay~ Leave it to Chocola!」
Kashou: 「Vanilla, I need your help in the kitchen.」
Vanilla: 「Hm? Me?」
Vanilla: 「... I have a hunch I'm needed for something naughty.」
Kashou: 「Just what kind of hunch is that?!」
It seemed that she was still holding a grudge.
It looked like she told Chocola something earlier too.
In any case, I needed to lighten things up.
Kashou: 「I thought I'd start to slowly teach you how to make a cake!」
Vanilla: 「Oh, cake making...! I'll finally level up as a catgirl...!」
Vanilla: 「... But why just me? Are you planning something lewd?」
Kashou: 「Can you stop it with that nonsense?」
Vanilla: 「I am enjoying it. I regret nothing.」
As always, she was quite the actress.
There wasn't really a reason for her to regret anything, though.
Kashou: 「Well, in all seriousness, I have no qualms with Chocola being a poster catgirl...」
Kashou: 「... but I don't think making cakes would suit her.」
Vanilla: 「Ahh. Chocola would probably just make things depending on her mood at the time. Understandable.」
Vanilla was the right catgirl for the job.
It'd be great if she's interested, but it'll be fine, even if she messes up.
Kashou: 「So, well, that's how it is. I'll start by teaching you how to make some simple dough, okay?」
Vanilla: 「It's happening! I'll let you teach me.」
Vanilla: 「I look forward to your lesson, Professor Master-sensei. Bow~」
It seems like she's more into it than I thought she'd be.
Vanilla: 「Master. Make it hard and pile it high with lots of butter, right?」
Kashou: 「We don't have that kind of customization available.」
Vanilla: 「If we did it, it might catch on. Nice idea.」
Kashou: 「We don't make them one at a time, so it wouldn't work out.」
Kashou: 「Enough about customizations. First, the basics.」
Vanilla: 「Okay~ I'll try to do my best.」
While she gave a half-hearted response, she measured out the ingredients very carefully according to the recipe.
She was quick to learn the names of the kitchen tools and how to use them...
... and remembered what I taught her without uttering a single complaint.
Kashou: 「You really take on things quickly, Vanilla.」
Kashou: 「Honestly, you're a lot more skilled with your paws than I thought.」
Vanilla: 「Skillful catgirls are lazybones you know, Professor Master-sensei.」
She puffed out her nonexistent chest proudly.
... The chest on that uniform might be too high a level for Vanilla.
Well, she picked it out herself, so I guess she didn't mind too much.
Maybe she was trying to show off her slightly lacking chest.
That trivial thought crossed my mind for a brief moment.
Vanilla: 「Shigure told me I'm a fast learner, too. Eheh~」
Kashou: 「Is that so? First time I've heard that.」
Vanilla: 「If it wasn't true, there would be no point for me to bring it up myself.」
Vanilla: 「Master doesn't usually joke around with others like this too, you know...」
Kashou: 「... Now that you mention it, you're right.」
It was more like neither of us were the type to come up with snappy retorts.
Vanilla also wasn't the type to talk about herself much, either.
I realized that I hadn't heard much about her.
Vanilla: 「I don't dislike that kind of distance between me and Master, though.」
Vanilla: 「It lets me be open and carefree, just like a catgirl should be.」
She smiled with her usual tone of voice.
If that's what makes Vanilla most comfortable, than I'm fine with that.
That was without a doubt.
It was without doubt, yet...
Kashou: 「Do you dislike it when I bother you, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「... Huh? Bother?」
She tilted her head to the side and blinked a few times in confusion.
Furrowing her brow, she put a hand to her chin as she thought.
Then she hit her palm with her first and looked over at me.
Vanilla: 「I see. Pick-up lines, huh.」
Kashou: 「You really need to quit it with these jokes of yours.」
I lightly bopped Vanilla on the head.
She really can't handle serious topics, can she?
I looked directly at Vanilla and returned to the topic at hand.
Kashou: 「I want to be to closer to you, Vanilla.」
Vanilla: 「Closer? You're close right now, though.」
Kashou: 「Not in a literal sense.」
Kashou: 「What I mean is that I want to know more about you and get along with you better.」
This time, I gently patted Vanilla on the head.
As usual, she had a baffled expression on her face as she looked up at me.
Kashou: 「I'm fine with the distance between us right now...」
Kashou: 「... but I want to be a better owner, you know?」
Kashou: 「That's why...」
Kashou: 「I want to know more about you. I want to understand you better, Vanilla.」
Kashou: 「You're one of my precious catgirls, after all, Vanilla.」
Vanilla: 「Master...」
Even with what happened with Chocola, I was concerned about Vanilla.
Vanilla was right. I didn't know much about her at all.
That's exactly why I wanted to know more.
The three of us will be together from now on, after all.
Vanilla: 「......」
Vanilla: 「... I'm not good with serious stuff like this.」
Vanilla: 「Master isn't good at this stiff stuff, either...」
... So Vanilla could be cute at times, too.
She pouted as her cheeks became rosy.
Vanilla mumbled as she looked up at me.
Perhaps she really does have a really low tolerance for serious matters.
Kashou: 「Well, I know it's a bit out of character for me, but...」
Kashou: 「... I wanted to get that out in the open.」
Kashou: 「At the very least, I wanted to tell you how I feel.」
As an unbefitting wry smile came across my face...
... I faced Vanilla and spoke my true feelings.
Vanilla: 「... Trying to ravish me, too.」
Kashou: 「I told you, that's not it--」
Vanilla: 「... Mm. I know. I was kidding.」
Vanilla: 「It's okay, I understand Master's feelings perfectly.」
... She was absolutely adorable.
That true smile.
This level of honesty she normally didn't show me was making my heart skip a beat.
No, no, no, no!
I'm having a serious discussion here!
This isn't the time for me to be thinking of how cute Vanilla was!
Vanilla: 「... Sniff, sniff.」
Vanilla: 「Huh? This smell...? Sniff sniff...?」
Kashou: 「Hm? Wh-What is it, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Something... sniff, smells really sweet... sniff.」
Kashou: 「H-Huh? Vanilla...?」
Vanilla: 「Sniff sniff, sniff sniff~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Haah... What a sweet and delicious smell~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Hey... H-Hey, Earth to Vanilla...?」
Kashou: 「Uhm, you're really close...」
I say "close," but it was more like she was stuck on to me.
Vanilla buried her face in my chest and continued to sniff.
Vanilla: 「Fuwah, such a thick, sweet smell~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「This... This is making my head melt, meow~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Master~ ♪ Give me more over here~ ♪」
She looked up and pushed her face up against my neck.
I could feel her body and lips pressed against me...
... as Vanilla's sweet smell and softness flowed throughout my entire body.
Kashou: 「Uwah...! Wait, Vanilla...!」
Vanilla: 「...... !」
Vanilla: 「N-No...! That was just a Flehmen response...!」
Kashou: 「Huh? Did you say Flehmen response--」
Vanilla: 「A Flehmen response. It was just a Flehmening.」
Kashou: 「... Well, let's just leave it at Flehmen response then.」
Vanilla: 「Mhm, very well. I shall return to my regular position, then.」
Kashou: 「...... Ah, sure.」
I left it at that.
Chocola: 「Thank you very much~!」
Chocola: 「Master~ ♪ Rub me, please~ Rub rub~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Hey, I told you, not during work.」
Chocola: 「There are no customers here right now, so it's fine! Just a little!」
Kashou: 「All right, all right. Just a bit, okay?」
Chocola: 「Yay~! Rub rub rub~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Okay, fully charged now!」
Chocola: 「Chocola is gonna go take out the trash!」
Kashou: 「... Sheesh, what a handful.」
Vanilla: 「Stare~」
Kashou: 「Hm? What is it, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Measuring the level of resolve on Master's face... Beep boop beep.」
Vanilla: 「Evaluation, Slack Level: Bulldog.」
Kashou: 「I can clearly sense the spite in that evaluation.」
Kashou: 「You were watching the whole time, weren't you?」
Vanilla: 「I wasn't. I was working diligently.」
Kashou: 「I wasn't saying you were slacking off or anything.」
Vanilla: 「I wasn't. I think you're being too self-conscious, Master.」
Kashou: 「No, I mean--」
Vanilla: 「Pervert.」
Kashou: 「Never mind.」
It was obvious that she was staring at me the whole time.
Was this some sort of new rebellious phase of hers?
I'm not sure catgirls even have rebellious phases, though.
Kashou: 「Anyways, the total sales for today is...」
Vanilla headed towards the register, paying me no heed.
Vanilla: 「......」
Vanilla: 「...... Fwiph.」
Kashou: 「...... Hm?」
Vanilla: 「Sniff sniff, sniff sniff sniff...」
Vanilla: 「Huff, puff~ Huff... puff~ ♪」
Kashou: 「...... Uhm, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Hmm~? Hmmmm~?」
Vanilla: 「Meow?! Meow meow meow?!」
Vanilla: 「Master, why are you pushing your back against me?」
Kashou: 「Wait, wait, wait.」
Kashou: 「You're the one who's pressed against me.」
Vanilla: 「... I am? Against Master?」
Vanilla: 「Hm...? Hmmmm...?」
Vanilla tilted her head with a perplexed look on her face.
... I've seen this reaction before.
It seemed similar to something that had just happened yesterday.
Kashou: 「Vanilla, could it be that you're...」
Vanilla: 「Ah, I'm going to go take out the trash. Excuse me.」
Kashou: 「Chocola is taking it out right now--」
Kashou: 「......」
This was how Chocola behaved yesterday.
Could it be... Vanilla is in heat...?
The two of them were twins.
It wouldn't be strange if they were going through the same stage...
Kashou: 「It isn't at the same level as Chocola was yesterday, though.」
Kashou: 「In any case, I'll just observe what she does a bit longer...」
Chocola: 「Chocola finished cleaning up the bakery~!」
Chocola: 「Chocola always does such a good job cleaning! Chocola's even impressed herself~」
Chocola: 「And that's why Chocola wants to be petted and praised!」
Kashou: 「All right, you did well. Pat pat.」
Vanilla: 「The tabletops haven't been wiped down yet.」
Chocola: 「Meowrghhh! Chocola will be back soon! Like a bird, Chocola flies! Meow~!」
Kashou: 「Chocola is as energetic as ever.」
Vanilla: 「That's one of Chocola's good points.」
Kashou: 「That's definitely true.」
Kashou: 「......」
Kashou: 「... Uhm, are you all right, Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「All right? What do you mean?」
Kashou: 「Well, like... how are you feeling?」
Vanilla: 「Feeling fine. All green.」
Kashou: 「... I see. Then that's good.」
Well, she seemed the same as usual.
Chocola would get visibly dizzy when she was in heat...
... so I guess Vanilla wasn't in heat after all.
Kashou: 「I'll be done cleaning up the kitchen shortly.」
Kashou: 「Vanilla, go and help Chocola.」
Vanilla: 「Roger. Leave it to me.」
Kashou: 「... Hm? Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「Meow... Master~ ♪ Rub rub~」
Vanilla: 「Sniff sniff, sniff sniff... Mereow~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「It's thicker... than before... rub rub~ ♪」
Kashou: 「H-Hey, Vanilla...?」
She came up and embraced me from the front...
... and rubbed her cheek up against mine, speaking in a sweet voice.
Kashou: 「H-Hey, Vanilla? Calm down, okay?」
Vanilla: 「Mreow...? Shigure says... I'm always clever...」
Vanilla: 「... !?」
Vanilla: 「N-No...!  That was a Flehmen response...!」
Kashou: 「No no no, enough of that.」
Vanilla: 「It's a Flehmening that surpasses Flehmening. A super Flehmening.」
Kashou: 「No, when you were studying for the Bell exam, I saw an actual Flehmen face.」
Kashou: 「Besides, you were the one that said that it wasn't good for your health to hold your urges in while in heat.」
Vanilla: 「Wrong. I am certainly not in heat. Nothing embarrassing like that.」
Kashou: 「 It's not something to be embarrassed about...」
I argued with Vanilla.
Was being in heat something to be embarrassed about?
I didn't think catgirls felt shame, though...
Chocola: 「 ...... Stare~」
Kashou: 「 Ah, Chocola.」
Vanilla: 「Is something wrong? You're making that face.」
Chocola: 「 ... Vanilla?」
Vanilla: 「 Me-Meow?! Hey, Chocola...!」
Chocola: 「 Mm... shlurp, li-lick... Mmph, slurp...」
Vanilla: 「Meow...! Ah, Hey! Chocola... Me-Meooow...!」
Vanilla: 「Ch-Chocola...! W-What are you... m-meowrh...!」
Chocola: 「Myaow, Vanilla's cute voice~ ♪ Lick, shlurp, lick, fuwah~ ♪」
Chocola's lips and tongue crept along the nape of Vanilla's neck.
With each wet, sticky sound, Vanilla's body twitched.
Vanilla: 「Haah... No, Chocola...! Myaoh, stop, haah...!」
Chocola: 「Teehee, her body's gone completely limp, meow! ♪ Vanilla is so cute~ ♪」
Chocola: 「Chocola has never seen such a cute, ecstasy-filled face before, meow! Haah~ ♪」
Kashou: 「H-Hey, Chocola...!」
Chocola: 「Teehe, it's okay, Master~」
Kashou: 「Okay...?」
Chocola: 「After all, Vanilla is in heat, right?」
Vanilla: 「N-No...! I'm not, really...!」
Chocola: 「Teehee, there's no way you could deceieve another catgirl, you know?」
Chocola: 「Look, your whole body is emitting such a sweet smell~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Ch-Chocola...!」
Chocola: 「Besides, we've always been together right, Vanilla?」
Chocola: 「You knew when Chocola was going through it though, right?」
Vanilla: 「Chocola...」
At a loss for words, Vanilla cast her eyes downwards.
She blushed, breathing in shallow, quick breaths.
She was gripping her shoulders as if she were trying to hold something back.
Kashou: 「... Vanilla, is she right?」
As her owner, I asked Vanilla once more.
Vanilla: 「......」
She looked at me with troubled, upturned eyes.
She answered me hesitantly...
Vanilla: 「...... Nod.」
... by bowing her head very slightly.
Kashou: 「So you really were after all.」
I did feel it was rather strange.
... But if that was the case, then Vanilla really does need to be relieved.
Vanilla's health will be affected if I don't do something.
So that meant I'd have to do the same to her as I did with Chocola--
Vanilla: 「......」
No no no no!!
Even if I am her owner, that wouldn't be the way to...!!
Chocola: 「Vanilla saw how lovey-dovey Master and Chocola were and wanted it too, didn't you?」
Vanilla: 「N-No...! That's not how it is...!」
Chocola: 「Didn't you say yourself that there's no point in trying to hide it?」
Vanilla: 「Ah...! Ch-Chocola...!?」
