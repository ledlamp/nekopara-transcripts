Chocola: 「Master~ ♪ Purr, purr, purr~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Chocola... Chocola~ ♪」
Chocola and Vanilla curled up, completely appeased.
Chocola was all back to normal after being satisfied.
Although, she could have just been exhausted after all that and would return to that state soon.
Kashou: 「... There's a lot to raising catgirls, huh.」
To think that raising catgirls would involve this as well.
I didn't think I'd become such a catgirl lover either.
Kashou: 「... Well, I have no regrets.」
With a slightly perplexed smile, I poked the cheeks of the two catgirls.
Chocola: 「Master... Chocola loves you. Chocola loves you... Eheheh~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「Mm... If Chocola is happy, then I'm happy too... Zzz zzz...」
Kashou: 「Yes, yes. I love you too.」
I responded to the two catgirls as they mumbled in their sleep while rubbing their heads.
They were like daughters... and even lovers.
Those feelings mixed together.
Kashou: 「... If you think about, as their owner and as a man, I guess I'm really lucky, huh.」
Absolutely honest goodwill with no mind games.
I guess that's what made catgirls so wonderful.
That's what I felt as I gazed at their innocent, sleeping faces.
Kashou: 「See you tomorrow, Chocola, Vanilla.」
I softly stroked their cheeks once more.
They responded to my caresses while sleeping...
Chocola: 「Good night... Master...」
Vanilla: 「Night, Master... Zzz zzz...」
I tidied up Chocola and Vanilla's bed.
I gazed upon their precious, sleeping faces one last time...
... and quietly left their room.
