Chocola: 「We're back~!」
Vanilla: 「We're back~」
Kashou: 「Oh, welcome home, you two.」
Kashou: 「Any problems with delivery or payment?」
Chocola: 「Of course not! It was a totally perfect delivery!」
Vanilla: 「Mission completed without incident. Perfect.」
Chocola: 「After all, Chocola and Vanilla...」
Chocola: 「... are splendid, Bell-holding catgirls! ♪」
Vanilla: 「Worrying is unnecessary with two Bell-holding catgirls around.」
The brand new Bells around Chocola and Vanilla's necks glittered brightly.
Chocola had a silver colored Bell...
... And Vanilla a gold colored one.
With proof that they had become independent catgirls, they both had blossoming smiles, full of pride on their faces.
Kashou: 「Well, they were really close to failing though.」
Chocola: 「Even if it was just by a hair, a pass is a pass~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「They say that the rate of passing on the first try is 5 percent.」
Vanilla: 「Besides, Chocola and I were the youngest catgirls in our group to pass. I think that calls for a bit more praise.」
Kashou: 「All right, all right. You two are La Soleil's star poster catgirls.」
I answered, rubbing their heads as always.
Actually, this was the first time we had received a delivery order from a customer.
With my cell phone I was able to check up on them to make sure everything was all right every few minutes through the GPS in their Bells.
I really did want to follow behind them, but I restrained myself.
It was their first errand, so naturally as their owner, I was fraught with worry and couldn't sit still.
Chocola: 「We made sure to say hi to everyone along the way too!」
Vanilla: 「We made sure to advertise the store perfectly as walking poster catgirls.」
Vanilla: 「If we raise the sales of the cafe, then I'll hope that we'll receive a reward.」
Chocola: 「Yay~ ♪ Chocola is fine with gaining the privilege to take baths with Master!」
Chocola: 「Ah, but Chocola would also be happy if you bought clothes and stuff for her too~ ♪ That's good from time to time!」
Vanilla: 「I also desire clothing. At the very least, I will put up with Master's perverted interests.」
Kashou: 「I wasn't going to acknowledge you, but since when did I have such interests?!」
Vanilla: 「I was thinking it would be a good idea to throw in a joke as a proud Bell-holder.」
I didn't think having a Bell was a qualification to become an entertainer...
Perhaps this was some of the additional vocabulary they had learned when studying for the exam.
It didn't seem like they were any different from before though.
Kashou: 「Okay, I'll think up something special. Don't get your hopes up though, okay?」
Chocola: 「Yay! Chocola loves Master~!」
Vanilla: 「Master is the best...!」
Taking a bath with me is completely out of the question though.
But saying that is a bit of a pain, so I won't mention anything.
Chocola: 「Meow~ ♪ Chocola's so happy that you're pleased with us meow~ ♪」
Chocola: 「"You two are La Soleil's star poster catgirls."」
Chocola: 「That's what you said~! Chocola is about to die from happiness~♪」
Kashou: 「Ouch! Ouch! Stop, that hurts!」
Vanilla: 「Now Master can't live without us.」
Chocola: 「Meow, do you really think so?! Bells are amazing! So amazing!!」
Kashou: 「Don't say things to deliberately confuse Chocola.」
Chocola: 「Chocola guesses that's true. We only just got our Bells after all. Ahaha...」
Vanilla: 「Ah, Chocola just got super depressed.」
Kashou: 「I told you not to do that, you trickster.」
Vanilla: 「Master's worth went way up, so now it's just right.」
Vanilla: 「Chocola will be back to normal soon anyways.」
Vanilla: 「Besides, Chocola looks so cute when she's down.」
Kashou: 「Aren't you clever.」
Well, I suppose I agree with her though.
She looks beyond cute when she's all sulky like this.
Kashou: 「Ah, looks like we're running low on supplies. I'm going to have to go out and buy a couple things on my break.」
Chocola: 「Shopping?! Chocola also wants to go! A shopping date!!」
Vanilla: 「See, she's already back to normal.」
Kashou: 「Well, there isn't a lot of time, so we need to get going.」
Chocola: 「Okay! Chocola's going to go get changed~ ♪」
Today was just another normal day at La Soleil.
Chocola: 「Huh? The takoyaki seller isn't here today either.」
Vanilla: 「We haven't seen them since the bakery opened.」
Kashou: 「Maybe it's their day off today or maybe they're only open when there's a lot of people around.」
Chocola: 「I was hoping that young catgirl would drop by our bakery too, meow.」
Vanilla: 「I even brought our bakery's business card to give to her. How unfortunate.」
Kashou: 「Well, we'll see them again some day.」
Kashou: 「You never know! We'll probably see them sometime in the future.」
Chocola: 「That's true. It's definitely possible~ ♪」
Vanilla: 「After all, our battle has only just begun.」
We crossed the park path that we had grown used to walking.
There was a gentle breeze blowing in from the coast.
Chocola: 「Mm~ This breeze feels nice. Chocola loves it.」
Vanilla: 「This is a place you can get used to living in. A new town isn't bad, either.」
The faintly salty breeze blew into their squinted eyes.
I turned around and saw a bench enter my line of vision.
Kashou: 「Well, there's still time, so why don't we take a break?」
Chocola: 「Yay, that sounds good~ ♪ Let's take a break!」
Vanilla: 「In that case, I shall go buy some drinks. With courageous heroism. Please give me money.」
Kashou: 「Thank you very much, Miss Vanilla.」
I gave the graceful poster catgirl money.
With light steps, Vanilla walked towards the vending machine.
Chocola: 「We sat here like this last time too, huh.」
Kashou: 「That's right. Just like this, huh.」
She was talking about the day after I moved.
It seemed like it was quite a while ago now.
Kashou: 「I wonder how things would've turned out if I had ended up on my own.」
Chocola: 「Chocola wonders too.」
Chocola: 「But one thing is certain. There's no point in thinking about it.」
Chocola fondly looked at me.
Kashou: 「That's true. No reason to talk about ifs and buts.」
Chocola: 「That's not it either, though.」
Kashou: 「It's not...?」
Kashou: 「... What do you mean?」
Not understanding what she meant, I asked again.
She closed her eyes a bit and I could see a faintly mischievous smile creep across her face.
Chocola: 「No matter what happens, Chocola will always be there with Master.」
Chocola: 「So that's why there's no point in thinking about things if you were by yourself.」
Kashou: 「... Chocola.」
Unexpectedly, my heart began to beat loudly.
... My face felt flushed.
I couldn't bear looking at such a genuine smile any longer.
As I averted my gaze away, the color of her silver Bell caught my eye.
... I always thought of her like a daughter, but she's growing up with each passing day.
Once again, I realized something that obvious.
I took a deep breath, cooling my flushed face.
Kashou: 「Ahh, please always be by my side from here on out.」
Kashou: 「I'm so happy when you're with me.」
I answered her honestly.
I rubbed Chocola's head more gently than usual.
Chocola: 「M-Master...?! Eh...? Fuwah...!」
Chocola: 「......」
Kashou: 「Hmm? What's wrong, Chocola?」
Chocola: 「I-It's nothing... meow...! Y-Yeah...!」
Kashou: 「You say it's nothing, but...」
Chocola: 「I-It's really is nothing...! Nothing at all meow...!」
Chocola: 「Well, actually, there's a really sweet smell... coming from you, Master, which kinda made Chocola space out...」
Kashou: 「A sweet smell... Hm?」
I tried to smell what she was talking about.
Of course, I didn't smell anything sweet.
Chocola: 「A sweet like... tingly feeling? It's like everything has become light...」
Chocola: 「B-But it's not a bad thing though. It feels kind of nice actually...」
Chocola: 「Ah, it's a bit like the sensation we had from that catnip before... Hauuu~」
She let out a long feverish sigh.
As she sighed, she gazed downwards with her face flushed red.
She glanced up at me, her eyes gleaming.
Chocola: 「Master...? Chocola will... uhm, will work even harder...!」
Chocola: 「So that Master will be even happier... Chocola will work hard...!」
She squeezed her hands tightly in front of her chest...
... as she said that to me with a sorrowful voice and forlorn look on her face.
... Things somehow feel a bit different than before.
I knew that she was happy, but it seemed like she was holding something back at the same time.
She wasn't like her usual feverish and energetic self.
It was almost as if--
Vanilla: 「Chocola?」
Chocola&Vanilla: 「Meoooooowwww?!」\n「Meoowww?!」
Kashou: 「Uwahh?!」
Chocola: 「Y-You surprised Chocola! You really did!! What are you trying to do, Vanilla? Sheesh!!」
Vanilla: 「Oh, this is what you'd call a false accusation. Or an unfounded suspicion.」
Kashou: 「Y-You two surprised me too...!」
Vanilla: 「It's your fault because you were using me to be able to get all close and lovey-dovey with Chocola.」
Kashou: 「I wasn't doing anything other than rubbing Chocola's head like always.」
Vanilla: 「Your scent is different. A catgirl's nose can't be fooled. Sniff sniff~」
Vanilla: 「In any case, I think I'm going to sit between Master and Chocola here. Move out of my way.」
Vanilla: 「If you don't make some space, I'm going to have to use force. I'm going to sit down here either way.」
Kashou: 「Wait up, wait up, wait up! You're pretty heavy there, Vanilla-san.」
Vanilla: 「Am not. Master is so rude.」
Kashou: 「That's not what I mean.」
Chocola: 「Meow~! That's not fair, getting to sit on Master's lap like that! Chocola wants to too! Here I go!」
Chocola: 「Give me one of Master's legs! That's fair, okay?」
Vanilla: 「This is what humans call "two blessings at once," right.」
Kashou: 「Before that, you two do know about the concept of public morals in society, right...」
Kashou: 「In any case, please get off my lap. Seriously, now.」
Vanilla: 「But you're enjoying this though. Denied.」
Chocola: 「Okay then, Chocola also denies your request~ Purr purr~ ♪」
Before I knew it, Chocola was her old self again.
Well, as long as she's happy, there's nothing to worry about, but...
In the end, my breaktime ended up not feeling like a break at all...
... and was completely spent with the two of them.
Vanilla: 「Chocola, can you give this invoice to Master?」
Chocola: 「Ah, o-okay. Understood! Chocola will go do that now!」
Chocola: 「Master, here is the invoice for tomorrow's order.」
Kashou: 「Sounds good, I'll take a look at it later.」
Chocola: 「Okay, I'll put it in the usual place then.」
Chocola: 「...... Stare.」
Chocola: 「......」
Chocola: 「...... Pat.」
Kashou: 「...... Hmm?」
Chocola: 「Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff, sniff...」
Chocola: 「Huff~ Pant... Huff~ ♪」
Kashou: 「... Uhm, Chocola-san?」
Chocola: 「Meow. What's up, Master~?」
Kashou: 「Uh, "Meow. What's up?" isn't the answer I'm looking for...」
Chocola: 「Hmm~? Mmm~?」
Chocola: 「Meow?! Meow, meow, meow?!」
Chocola: 「Wh-Why is Chocola stuck to Master's back?!」
Chocola: 「Master, you shouldn't force Chocola onto your back, okay?!」
Kashou: 「Hold up, hold up. Clearly, you stuck yourself onto me, Chocola.」
Chocola: 「Huh...? Chocola did? To Master?」
Kashou: 「Yeah. Exactly that.」
Chocola: 「Hmm...? Hmmmm...?」
Chocola: 「... Even with that said, I don't think I would've...?」
Puzzled, she frantically tilted her head left and right.
... Is she sick with some terrible disease?
This just started happening mere seconds ago though.
Kashou: 「Are you all right?」
Kashou: 「You've been kind of out of it since we got back from our break.」
Chocola: 「Ch-Chocola is fine! Chocola is a Bell-holding catgirl after all!」
Chocola: 「Anyways, I left the invoice over there! Later!」
Kashou: 「... Well, if she says she's fine, then I guess there's nothing wrong.」
It didn't seem like she was making any particular mistakes while working either.
I'll think about things after observing her a bit more.
I thought about that as I watched her head back.
Chocola: 「Sigh... pant... sigh~」
Vanilla: 「Are you all right, Chocola?」
Chocola: 「Meow? Ah, yeah, Chocola was just thinking that today is kinda hot.」
Vanilla: 「I don't think it's any hotter than usual though...」
Chocola: 「Ah, we're almost out of mille-feuille.」
Chocola: 「Chocola's going to go let Master know.」
Vanilla: 「Ah, Chocola...」
Kashou: 「Oh, Chocola. What's wrong?」
Chocola: 「Ah, Master...」
Chocola: 「Meow, uhm... well, uhm... What did Chocola need to tell you again?」
Kashou: 「You're telling me...」
Chocola spaced out as she tilted her head in confusion again.
It didn't seem like she was doing it on purpose...
I wonder what's gotten into her?
It was clear that she wasn't herself.
Somehow, she looks a bit flushed too.
Kashou: 「I'm just going to feel your forehead here, okay?」
Chocola: 「Hyaugh...! M-Master...!」
I touched her small forehead.
Her body shivered with a twitch.
I could feel Chocola shivering slightly through the palm of my hand.
It didn't particularly seem like she had a fever or anything...
Chocola: 「Au... haa, Master...」
Kashou: 「Huh, Chocola...?」
Chocola: 「Meow~ ♪ Sniff, sniff... meowww, Master~ ♪」
Kashou: 「Wait, Chocola...? H-Hey...」
Chocola: 「Sniff, sniff... Master smells so sweet~ ♪ Haah, meow~ ♪」
She cooed in a sweet voice I hadn't heard before.
Still clinging to me, she rubbed her cheek against mine.
Chocola: 「Master... Master~ ♪ Purr, purr, purr~ ♪」
It was clear that she wasn't feeling like herself.
Her voice was especially sugary sweet.
You could even say that there was a stickiness to it.
Her grip on my back tightened.
I could feel a certain degree of sensuality in her actions.
Chocola: 「Ah...! Ch-Chocola is sorry...!!」
Chocola: 「U-Uhm... Oh, errands! Chocola had errands to do, right?! Uhm... uhm, well...!」
She suddenly came to her senses and let go of me.
She flailed her arms about as she howled in confusion.
Vanilla: 「Chocola, about the mille-feuille...」
Chocola: 「Ah, yes! That's it! Thanks for the help, Vanilla!」
Chocola: 「Master, we're almost out of mille-feuille, so Chocola's going to bring out some more!」
Chocola: 「It's in the back refrigerator, right? Mille-feuille, mille-feuille...」
Vanilla: 「......」
Kashou: 「Hey, Vanilla. Do you know what's with Chocola?」
Kashou: 「She's acting weird today, right?」
Vanilla: 「She can be silly sometimes, but she's definitely being weird today.」
A breakthrough.
This felt promising.
Kashou: 「By the way, I've been curious, but...」
Kashou: 「Do I smell strange or something?」
Vanilla: 「Normal.」
Kashou: 「... Right?」
It was somewhat relieving to hear that I smelled normal.
Well, it meant that I didn't smell especially sweet or anything.
Vanilla: 「Could it be...? Hrmm. There's no proof though...」
Kashou: 「?」
Vanilla was drawn in by what I had said.
It seemed as if she realized something.
Kashou: 「Either way, can you tell Chocola to go up to her room to rest?」
Vanilla: 「Okay, but what about the bakery?」
Kashou: 「It's starting to calm down out there, so I'll take care of things afterwards.」
Chocola: 「Wh-What?! Chocola is totally fine though!」
Chocola: 「After all, Chocola has a Bell, a Bell! This is proof that Chocola is a mature catgir--」
Vanilla: 「Mission acknowledged. Chocola has been captured. Engaging Eviction Mode.」
Chocola: 「Meowwwwwww! Master, s-save me...! Chocola... Chocola is--!!」
Kashou: 「......」
Kashou: 「Let's see, we needed some more mille-feuille, right.」
Surprisingly, Vanilla was the type who could rise to a challenge when necessary.
I stood in front of the wide-open refrigerator...
... and despite the distance, I could still hear the voices of my poster catgirls right behind me.
Chocola: 「Pant... mm, pant...」
Chocola: 「Oh no... Chocola can't stop her heart from beating so fast...」
Chocola: 「Just thinking about... Master's scent... Hauuu...」
Chocola: 「This feeling... inside Chocola's body... it's so hot... and overwhelming... Haah...」
Chocola: 「Mm... ah, it... it feels good to touch Chocola here...」
Chocola: 「Mmph, myah... haah, auu... M-mmph...」
Kashou: 「Are you feeling any better, Chocola?」
Chocola: 「Meeeeeeeeeeowwwww?!」
Kashou: 「Uwaagh?!」
Chocola: 「M-Master! I-It's common courtesy to knock when coming into someone's room meow!!」
Kashou: 「Huh? A-Ahh. Really? Sorry about that...」
I didn't really get why, but she was pretty mad at me.
I've never knocked on their doors before now though...
Besides, Chocola would enter my room without knocking too.
Kashou: 「Okay, well, I'll be sure to be careful next time, but more importantly, how are you feeling?」
Kashou: 「I'd like to take you to the clinic, but do you feel up to walking there?」
Chocola: 「Huh...? The clinic...?」
Chocola: 「Ah, Master... What about the bakery...?」
Kashou: 「We're closed. We decided to close up early today.」
Chocola: 「Closed... Huh, wh-why?」
Kashou: 「Do you think I could leave you be when you're not feeling well?」
Kashou: 「Just listen to me and let's go up to the clinic. Do you think you can stand?」
Chocola: 「D-Don't...! If you come too close...!」
Kashou: 「What are you talking about? You look like you're about to fall over.」
Kashou: 「Come on, I'll give you a hand.」
I stood next to Chocola and put my arm around her.
Chocola: 「Ahhh...! M-Master... Haah, meowwww...!」
Kashou: 「Wh-What's wrong? Did I hurt you?」
Chocola: 「I-It isn't pain...! Fuwahh... It's just that sweet smell of yours...」
Chocola: 「Pant, pant... Chocola really doesn't need to go to the clinic, so... myaahhh...」
She slurred her words as she refused my request.
She was definitely acting a lot stranger than before.
Kashou: 「Enough with that now. I'm taking you to the clinic, okay?」
Kashou: 「That's the whole reason why I decided to close the bakery today anyways. Come on now.」
Chocola: 「Ch-Chocola ishh a mature Bell-holdin' catgrrrl thoughhh...」
Chocola: 「Chocola's Bell ishh rational proof that sheesh a catgrrrl that can hold back from her instinctshh... Hauun...」
Kashou: 「Rational? Hold back from your instincts...?」
Vanilla: 「Chocola, could it be... sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff~」
Vanilla pushed her face against Chocola's body as she sniffed her.
Vanilla: 「I knew it. You came?」
Kashou: 「"Came...?"」
Kashou: 「... You don't mean, that mating season thing, right?」
Now that she mentioned it, that was noted in the book I bought before.
I thought that it was still a bit early for them though...
Chocola: 「Ch-Chocola gets it! Chocola gets it already...!」
Chocola: 「Chocola understands that Master didn't mean anything else when he was praising Chocola, but...!」
Kashou: 「Ahh, please always be by my side from here on out.」
Kashou: 「I'm so happy when you're with me.」
Chocola: 「M-Master...?! Huh...? Fuwah...!」
Chocola: 「Well, actually, there's a really sweet smell... coming from you, Master, which kinda made Chocola space out...」
Kashou: 「... Since back then, huh.」
"Situations When Dealing With A Fast Maturing Catgirl"
I remembered that a section inside the book was titled that.
Crap.
I thought that it was still too early to worry about stuff like that and totally glossed over it.
Well, just what... should I do in a situation like this...?
Chocola: 「Haah... Auuuh... Master...」
She looked up at me with pained, tear-stained eyes.
It was the look of a woman desperately pleading for help.
Kashou: 「Chocola...」
She had completely caught me off guard, and in an instant, my face began to redden.
... This is bad.
I could see that Chocola was not herself.
My heartbeat started to slow down as it began to throb profusely.
Vanilla: 「Master.」
Vanilla: 「If a catgirl in heat isn't able to let out her feelings properly, it could have an adverse effect on her health.」
Kashou: 「By let out, you mean...? Vanilla...?!」
Vanilla was right next to my ears as I looked over at her face.
This didn't seem like one of her usual jokes.
She was looking straight at me.
Vanilla: 「Besides, it's because Chocola loves Master that this happened.」
Vanilla: 「I know that catgirls and humans can't have children together...」
Vanilla: 「... But they can express their love for each other physically.」
Kashou: 「"Express their love for each other physically...?!"」
What unreserved and certain words.
I felt like I couldn't breathe.
Vanilla paid no attention to me and continued to whisper into my ear.
Vanilla: 「There are humans out there who make catgirls their life partners, right?」
Kashou: 「Well, you... y-you are right, but...」
Of course, I knew there were people like that.
I knew just how cute catgirls were, so I wasn't one to judge them.
But that being said...
Vanilla: 「Master, you like Chocola... right?」
Kashou: 「Well... Of course, she's important to me...」
Chocola and Vanilla were important, irreplaceable members of my family.
This wasn't a matter of liking or disliking them.
But that's why in the current of all this...
Vanilla: 「Even though you're a human, have you already forgotten, Master?」
Kashou: 「Forgotten...?」
Vanilla: 「We're catgirls, so we have to be honest.」
Vanilla: 「We're catgirls, so we have to be honest.」
Vanilla: 「If we really love you, then even if it's troublesome, we want to be with you. That is a reason to want to be with you.」
Vanilla: 「Stuff like whether we'd be happy or not... Even though you're our Master, don't you think it's wrong for you to decide that?」
Vanilla: 「So if you really feel that way about Chocola, then... Got it?」
Kashou: 「... Vanilla.」
Her slender fingers caressed my cheek.
They were the same words as before...
... And they pierced right through me again, just like back then.
Chocola: 「... Master.」
Chocola: 「Chocola really loves Master...」
Chocola: 「Chocola loves you, so Chocola wants to be someone important to you...」
Chocola: 「... Chocola wanted to be praised by you, so Chocola did her best.」
Kashou: 「Chocola...」
Just like back then...
... you could feel the determination behind Chocola's eyes and words.
She gazed right at me.
Chocola: 「The reason why Chocola's body is like this could be because Chocola's in heat... but still...」
Chocola: 「But still, the reason why Chocola loves Master is...」
Chocola: 「And the reason why Chocola wants to be touched by Master isn't because Chocola's in heat... It's, well, you know...」
Chocola: 「It's because... Chocola... Chocola really loves Master...!」
Kashou: 「Chocola.」
Chocola: 「Hm... M-Master...」
Chocola: 「Mm...」
Chocola: 「Haah... Master...」
I returned her gaze...
... as Chocola took hot, shallow breaths, still caught in her bewilderment.
I gently placed my hand to her tear-stained cheek.
Kashou: 「... I love you too, Chocola.」
Kashou: 「If you really desire to, then rather than deciding whether it's right or wrong...」
Kashou: 「I'll be honest too.」
With those words as my vow to her, I kissed her again.
Chocola: 「Master... Master...」
Vanilla: 「Teehee, you really are a complex person, Master.」
Kashou: 「Ahh, that's right.」
I gently rubbed both the teary eyed Chocola and the proud Vanilla's heads.
I then gently embraced both of them.
Vanilla: 「Okay, you better get going then, Master.」
